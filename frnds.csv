Monica," There's nothing to tell! He's just 

some guy I work with!",11
Joey," C'mon, you're going out with the 

guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!",14
Chandler," 
All right Joey, be nice.  

So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?",16
Phoebe," Just, 'cause, I don't want her to 

go through what I went through with Carl- oh!",16
Monica," Okay, everybody relax. This is not 

even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.",21
Chandler," Alright, so I'm back in high 

school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally 

naked.",22
Chandler," Then I look down, and I realize 

there's a phone... there.",11
Chandler," All of a sudden, the phone 

starts to ring. Now I don't know what to 

do, everybody starts looking at me. ",21
Chandler," Finally, I 

figure I'd better answer it, and 

it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls 

me!",23
Ross," I just feel like someone reached 

down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied 

it around my neck...",25
Monica," (explaining to the others) Carol 

moved her stuff out today. ",10
Phoebe," Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at 

the air just in front of Ross.)",14
Ross," No, no don't! Stop cleansing my 

aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?",14
Ross," 
I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very 

happy.",12
Ross," No I don't, to hell with her, she 

left me!",10
Ross," No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep 

fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?",16
Chandler," Sometimes I wish I was a 

lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?",18
Ross," I told mom and dad 

last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.",14
Joey," Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a 

lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the 

answer is?",23
Ross," I don't want to be single, okay? I 

just... I just- I just wanna be married again!",17
Chandler," And I just want a million 

dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)",12
Rachel," Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I 

just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big 

hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!",34
Monica," (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to 

All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) 

This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my 

brother Ross? ",33
Monica," So you wanna tell us now, or are 

we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?",14
Monica," Now I'm guessing that he bought 

her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. ",18
Ross," (in a deep voice) 

I'll have whatever Christine is having.",10
Rachel," (on phone) Daddy, I just... I 

can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!

",21
Rachel," C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's 

like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! 

You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I 

said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? 

Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a 

ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!",82
Rachel," Look Daddy, it's my life. Well 

maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. ",13
Monica," Well, I guess we've established 

who's staying here with Monica...",10
Rachel," Well, maybe that's my decision. 

Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!",17
Phoebe," (grins and walks to the kitchen 

and says to Chandler and Joey.) I helped!",14
Monica," Okay, look, this is probably for 

the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  

The whole, 'hat' thing.",19
Joey," (comforting her) And hey, you need 

anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And 

he's away a lot.",25
Monica," (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I 

mean, do you want me to stay?",14
Ross," (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul 

the Wine Guy!",10
Phoebe," What does that 

mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't 

know.)",18
Monica," Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They 

are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.",20
Chandler," I'm sorry, I didn't catch your 

name. Paul, was it?",10
Monica," 
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I 

just gotta go ah, go ah...",14
Phoebe," Ooh, I just pulled out four 

eyelashes. That can't be good.",11
Joey," Here's a little tip, 

she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and 

over again until it starts to get a little red.",31
Ross," So Rachel, what're you, uh... 

what're you up to tonight?",10
Rachel," Well, I was kinda supposed to be 

headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!",15
Ross," Right, you're not even getting your 

honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- 

(thinks) -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, 

Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.",45
Rachel," Well actually thanks, but I think 

I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  

It's been kinda a long day.",19
Phoebe," Oh, I wish I could, but I don't 

want to.",10
Phoebe," (singing) Love is 

sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your 

love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  

La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some change and to that guy) Thank you. 

(sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!",44
Ross," (squatting and reading the 

instructions) I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using 

a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys 

whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.",41
Chandler," I 

would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.",10
Ross," (clutching a beer can and sniffing) 

This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should 

have known.",23
Joey," Hey-hey-hey-hey, if 

you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.",11
Joey," Ross, let me ask you a question. She 

got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?",20
Monica," My brother's going through that 

right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?",17
Monica," You actually broke her watch?  

Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath 

towel.",20
Rachel," Barry, I'm sorry... I am so 

sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other 

day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's 

about me, and I ju- (She stops talking and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me 

off again... anyway...look, look, I know 

that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but 

it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but 

you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she 

redials.)",111
Chandler," You must stop! 

(Chandler hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)",16
Chandler," Look, Ross, you 

gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted 

longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a 

woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which 

she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that 

was my point!",62
Ross," You know what the scariest part is? 

What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one 

woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for 

her...",38
Joey," What are you talking about? 'One 

woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme 

tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, 

and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or 

nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You 

got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a 

spoon!",77
Monica," Yeah... yeah, I think there is. 

-What were you gonna say?",11
Monica," (spitting out her drink in shock) 

Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...",17
Monica," I know being spit on is probably 

not what you need right now. Um... how long?",16
Ross," (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know 

how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a 

hero' mean anything to you? ",28
Joey," Great story!  But, I 

uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to 

Chandler)",19
Ross," Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I 

could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He 

gazes out of the window.)",29
Rachel," Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have 

never made coffee before in my entire life.",15
Rachel," Y'know, I figure 

if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.",14
Chandler," If can invade 

Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.",10
Joey," Listen, while you're on a roll, if 

you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and 

Chandler taste the coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although 

actually I'm really not that hungry...",40
Monica," (entering, to 

herself) Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.",10
Joey," That wasn't a real date?! What the 

hell do you do on a real date?",15
Chandler," All right, kids, I gotta get to 

work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...

",21
Monica," Yeah, we all have jobs. See, 

that's how we buy stuff.",11
Monica," Oh wait, wait, unless you happened 

to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, 

at the little theater in the park.",20
Joey," I will not take this abuse. (Walks 

to the door and opens it to leave.)",15
Chandler," You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst 

into song and dances out of the door.) ""Once I was a wooden boy, a little 

wooden boy...""",23
Rachel," I can see that. You look like you 

slept with a hanger in your mouth.",15
Monica," I know, he's just so, so... Do you 

remember you and Tony DeMarco?",13
Monica," I think we are 

getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am 

just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm 

just gonna get up and go to work.",41
Rachel," I'm gonna go get one of those 

(Thinks) job things.",10
Joey, (sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line! ,12
Monica," Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that? ",10
Ross," I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to 

get you into bed'. ",15
Phoebe," Oh no, don't hate, 

you don't want to put that out into the universe.",14
Monica," Is it me? Is it like I have some 

sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?

",23
Phoebe," All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts 

massaging them.) ",10
Joey," (bursts out laughing again) I can't believe you 

didn't know it was a line! ",14
Rachel," Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was 

laughed out of twelve interviews today. ",15
Rachel," You would be too if you found John and David 

boots on sale, fifty percent off! ",16
Rachel," They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't 

need my parents, I've got great boots' boots! ",18
Rachel," Oh God, come on 

you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
",19
Monica," C'mon, you can't live off your parents your 

whole life. ",10
Phoebe," Give her a break, it's hard being on your own 

for the first time. ",14
Phoebe," You're welcome. I remember when I first came to 

this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was 

back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living 

with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, 

and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know 

exactly how you feel. ",72
Rachel," No.  No, no, I'm 

not ready!  How can I be ready?  ""Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane 

without your parachute?""  Come on, I can't do this!",29
Ross," Come on, you made 

coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant 

from that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)",30
Rachel," Y'know what?  I 

think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...",17
Chandler," (as Rachel is 

cutting up her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand 

retailers scream. ",19
Monica," Welcome to the real world! It 

sucks. You're gonna love it! ",11
Monica," Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on 

the couch? ",11
Rachel," Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. 

(Monica smiles.) What? ",13
Monica," That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where 

you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody. ",17
Ross," Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, 

no- ",10
Ross," Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably 

didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.

",24
Ross," You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought 

I was Monica's geeky older brother. ",15
Ross," Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my 

intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it 

would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe? ",35
Ross," I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica 

has no idea what that means.) ",15
Monica," I said that you 

had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.",14
Joey," Oh, you wouldn't 

know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.",14
Rachel," (walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody 

like more coffee? ",12
Chandler," Did you make it, or are you just serving it?

",10
Chandler," Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. 
(Rachel sits down to hear Chandler's dream.)",14
Rachel," Ugh. (To another customer 

that's leaving.) Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? (Hands 

him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thank you. (To the gang.) Sorry.  

Okay, Las Vegas.",36
Monica," What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as 

important as any part of it. ",17
Rachel, Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. ,10
Chandler," Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening 

act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through 

before Pink Floyd comes out. ",31
Ross," Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's 

that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. ",19
Chandler," The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter 

how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, 

y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just 

trying to stay awake. ",40
Ross," No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem 

a little angry? ",16
Ross," Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, 

that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? ",17
Ross," Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up 

with you in the Ice Age. ",18
Ross," Hi. (Hugs Carol while holding one of the Cavemen’s mannequins 

arms)",11
Ross," Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? 

Still, uh... ",13
Chandler," Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where 

there's some kind of misunderstanding. ",16
Phoebe,...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) ,10
Monica, (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? ,10
Chandler," Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, 

and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica 

is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. ",40
Phoebe," She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've 

already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! ",19
Monica," Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more 

ammunition than they already have. ",18
Chandler," Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the 

flatness of a child's pillow. ",18
Joey,"  

Would you relax? You do this every time they come. The place looks great. (sees 

a lasagna) You gotta beautiful lasagna here that looks good enough to…(about to 

touch it but Monica slaps his hands) avoid touching.  ",37
Phoebe," Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're 

like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way. ",23
Joey," Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and 

twirly every time they come. ",16
Monica," That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do 

no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I 

was born. ",28
Chandler," (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! ",12
Rachel," Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to 

look under the couch cushions.) ",19
Rachel," Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it 

back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on 

your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to 

return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... ",55
Monica," 

It’s going to be ok. You’re going to give it back to him and it will all be 

over. And we’ll eat a lot of ice cream.",27
Monica," 

(interrupts) I’ll tell you what? Any diamond ring we find, we’ll run it by you.


",15
Rachel," I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was 

in the kitchen with... ",20
Rachel," (looks at the lasagna and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be 

mad... ",11
Monica," I gave you one job! (Starts to examine the lasagna through the 

bottom of the glass pan.) ",17
Chandler," Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an 

engagement ring in a lasagna... ",16
Ross," Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am 

right about now. (He enters.) ",18
Chandler," Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?

",10
Rachel," Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? ",10
Ross," Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if 

I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's 

entirely up to me. ",30
Chandler," I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. ",11
Joey," And 

the most enjoyable. (only he laughs) Phoebe, say something!",10
Ross," 

Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.


",14
Ross," Yeah, 

remember back when life was simpler and she was just a lesbian.",13
Ross," I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be 

a father. ",16
Monica," I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? ",10
Monica," No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. ",12
Monica," Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?

",11
Monica," I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were 

you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it 

might take some of the heat off me. ",32
Monica," (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's 

going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no 

little anecdotes to share with the folks? ",31
Ross," (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- 

I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and 

me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman 

named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise 

the baby. ",57
Ross," Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're 

doing, they take their time, they get the job done. ",20
Monica," Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if 

you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. ",19
Phoebe," Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven 

career type. ",11
Phoebe," 

Yeah people say we look a like but I don’t see it. ",12
Rachel," All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all 

start to leave.) ",15
Monica," Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of 

this. ",12
Chandler," Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my 

parents actually preferred. ",14
Rachel," Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits 

down.) ",12
Ross," Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about 

Barry tomorrow? ",13
Rachel," So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- 

dumped? ",11
Ross," Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances 

are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try 

not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go 

down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and 

Susan to the OB/GYN... ",63
Rachel," Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so 

complicated? ",11
Rachel," I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet someone, 

fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? ",23
Rachel," Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto 

his hand.) ",14
Ross," Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to 

move his hand.) ",16
Ross," (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this 

big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. ",16
Ross," (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good 

shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? ",17
Ross," -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?

",10
Ross," Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- 

Oh.  ",12
Ross," (picks up a surgical instrument and mimes a duck with it) Quack, 

quack.. ",13
Ross," So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this 

all going to work? ",12
Ross," Thank 

you. I mean-I mean…how is
this going to work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important 

decisions have to be made? 

",22
Ross," Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, 

with the baby's name? ",17
Ross," Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. 

how about Julia? ",15
Ross," 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives 

together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the 

table..? ",25
Rachel," And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in 

your eye! ",13
Rachel," Anyway, um, (Gets the ring out of her purse.) I guess this 

belongs to you. Or…. hey maybe someday Mindy.",20
Rachel,"
(sarcastically laughs) Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah  

that’s true.  Umm, but I think it’s a-I think it’s a nice ring.  And 

thank you for giving it to me. ",27
Ross," Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? ",11
Ross," Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.

",11
Ross," No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. ",12
Ross," My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the 

ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know 

what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- ",41
Ross," You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can 

be involved in this particular thing right now. ",22
Chandler," I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the 

Enterprise. ",11
Phoebe," You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your 

eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. ",21
Ross," (walks over to where Monica is standing) Monica. Whaddya think?

",10
Rachel," (on phone) Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I 

saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two 

are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works 

out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just 

hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. (Slams the phone down.) (To 

everyone) Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much 

better now. ",88
Phoebe," Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We 

should do this again!' ",17
Rachel," What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? ",11
Monica," Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 

'You will never see me naked'. ",16
Joey," Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not 

you' means 'It is you'. ",15
Chandler," Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating 

leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. ",19
Phoebe," Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 

'Ha, ha, I already am'. ",17
Chandler," Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your 

dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. ",27
Ross," That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, 

uh, send our dog off to live on a farm. ",20
Ross," What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, 

they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could 

chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi! ",35
Chandler," ""So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"" ",10
Joey," ""Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have 

to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."" ",25
Joey," ""I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can 

smoke."" ",15
Chandler," I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell 

alone. ",12
Joey," No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette. ",10
Chandler," It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or 

not? Here. ",14
Chandler," Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing 

that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You 

feel complete. ",29
Chandler," Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) 

Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke.) ",18
Joey," 

Chandler give me that. (starts chasing him into the kitchen)",10
Chandler," 

No no, you’ve got your options.  You can smoke it like this (demonstrates).


",13
Chandler," 

Or you can hold it in your mouth and smoke it like this (demonstrates).",14
Joey," 
Chandler, give me the cigarette. Give me it, give me 

it!",11
Chandler," 
That’s not bad. All right, now when you’re 

finished it’s really cool if you flick it. You kinda flick it. You flick it. 

(Joey does do) That’s good. Now you keep practicing and uh-I’ll go put out the 

sofa.",39
Chandler," 

 I thought it had to do with size of a guy’s feet.",12
Monica," No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the 

tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger. ",25
Chandler," 

(comparing the size of his foot with his stretched fingers) I’m going to go with 

the foot theory.",18
Rachel," (carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell 

me! (Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. 

And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this! ",33
Phoebe," Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank. ",11
Phoebe," It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and 

I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT- ",19
Phoebe, - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. ,10
Phoebe," Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.

",13
Phoebe," It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be 

like stealing. ",16
Rachel," Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! ",11
Phoebe," Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. 

Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. 

Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, 

not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'... ",40
Phoebe," Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be 

like this giant karmic debt. ",18
Phoebe," Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!

",12
Ross," Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went 

through the last time you quit. Nah you know what? 

Forget about you! Think about what we went through the last time you quit.


",35
Chandler," All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops 

it in Phoebe's coffee.) ",16
Monica," 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having 

fun. ",10
Chandler," What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was 

schhexy!.. Sorry. ",12
Monica," Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me 

a chance to figure that out. ",20
Monica," I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy 

home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- 

coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd. ",37
Monica," I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they 

actually liked. ",16
Monica," I 

know. I know!  You mind if I whimper a little bit?",12
Monica, (shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good? ,10
Joey," You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay 

outside! ",13
Phoebe," 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our 

error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for 

the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -football 

phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand 

dollars, and a football phone! ",54
Monica," (to all) Okay, please be good, please. Just remember 

how much you all like me. ",15
Monica," (to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) 

Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, 

hmm? ",25
Ross," ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm 

sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him. ",24
Monica," Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm 

going out with? ",12
Chandler," I 

will never look at an olive the same way again.",11
Rachel," And did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index 

finger.) ",11
Joey, Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked. ,11
Phoebe," From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a 

crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...' ",22
Ross," ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all 

future boyfriends will be measured. ",16
Rachel," What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, 

y'know, it. ",13
Chandler," Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof 

impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the 

impression) ",25
Ross," He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny 

cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it 

was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-... ",30
Rachel," I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.

",14
Chandler," Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewelers a thing or two 

about softball.. ",13
Monica," Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is 

maybe.. sometimes.. ",15
Rachel," Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan. ",10
Phoebe," Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, ""sometimes y"". Uh, 

I also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.) ",24
Phoebe," No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football 

phone? ",12
Phoebe," No, I want you to have it. I don't want it. ",11
Phoebe," Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?

",12
Phoebe," I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating 

in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker! ",21
Chandler," Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?

",10
Chandler," So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant 

knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every 

single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell 

is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?

",49
Joey," Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe 

chews her hair? ",16
Ross," Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.

",11
Rachel," ""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work. ",10
Phoebe," Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually 

ordered. ",10
Rachel," Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.

",10
Monica," Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?

",13
Monica," Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really 

like. ",13
Monica," Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the 

thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing. ",23
Monica," No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about. ",11
Chandler," Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and 

your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and 

you know it. ",30
Rachel," (holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It's Alan, he 

wants to speak to you. ",15
Chandler," Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! 

Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, 

yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- 

no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone 

back and stubs out his cigarette.) ",59
Chandler," Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my 

hand for thirty years it'd be talking too. ",22
Ross," Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. 

(Does so.) ",12
Chandler," Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think 

that was wrong? ",17
Ross," Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?

",11
Phoebe," Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven 

thousand dollars for the thumb. ",14
Phoebe," And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with 

the universe?! ",16
Joey," (dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) 

What's going on? ",15
Monica," Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.

",11
Joey," Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. (sits 

down on the couch)",14
Rachel," Oh 

speaking of which, did you tell him that we’re on for the Renaissance Fair next 

weekend?


",17
Monica," Guys, before you get into that, 

there's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to 

say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan. ",30
Phoebe," You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care 

about someone, and I just- I- (starts chewing her hair) ",22
Monica," No!-but that wouldn't be fair 

to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you! ",19
Ross," Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the 

way they were. ",14
Rachel," (tearful) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays 

coming up- I wanted him to meet my family- ",20
Ross," Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time. ",12
Rachel," Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That 

was fun. ",13
Monica, He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (dubious look) ,10
Chandler," (leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! 

I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke! ",19
Phoebe," (shouting as he leaves) If you never smoke again I'll give you 

seven thousand dollars! ",15
Phoebe," Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We 

should do this again!' ",17
Rachel," What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? ",11
Monica," Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 

'You will never see me naked'. ",16
Joey," Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not

seven thousand dollars! ",15
Monica, Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.,11
Ross," Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, 

there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as 

far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I 

right?",46
Joey," Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time 

they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is 

beyond me.",32
Phoebe," Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many 

mean things, and then not even care.",22
Chandler," So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday 

night, Sat-ur-day night!",12
Monica," Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone

except for Kevin Millmore, may he rot in hell. 

You just gotta do it.",21
Chandler," No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're 

sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally 

get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've 

handed her the note. You try to, y’know, run out of 

the restaurant before she’s actually finished the note.


",61
Joey," Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop 

calling. ",15
Phoebe," You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.",10
Chandler," Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on 

her. ",13
Phoebe," No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with 

Tony. ",14
Phoebe," Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you 

know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.",27
Ross," Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolaty kind 

of a cakey pie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I'm 

fine.",27
Rachel, It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.,11
Rachel," Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was 

horrible. He called me young lady.",19
Rachel," Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, 

with three choruses of ""You'll never make it on your own"".",21
Joey," No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One 

Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he 

walks over to her) Hey, Angela. ",30
Ross," So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?",11
Ross," Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's 

doing laundry there too?",15
Ross," Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just 

join you both, there?",17
Ross," Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's 

a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're 

goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?",37
Joey," Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, 

but like, talking too.",17
Joey," Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner 

together tonight? You know, as friends?",20
Joey," You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.",13
Joey," Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.",10
Monica, Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.,11
Joey," Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... 

brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on 

three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...",37
Joey," Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her 

brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.",21
Monica, What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.,11
Joey," (proud) I know, but, I wanna be kind, 

y’know, like a snowflake or…or a…",14
Joey," 
Yea-yea. I made a huge mistake. I never should 

have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?",19
Ross," (on the phone) Hold on a sec. (To 

Chandler) You need not to touch any of those (Chandler quits playing with them).(on 

the phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me 

and Rachel.",39
Chandler," Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this 

thing through?",13
Chandler," It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a 

date. You're going on a date.",19
Ross," The 

point is, is it a date if she doesn’t know we’re going on a date?",16
Ross,"
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, 

what?",14
Chandler," Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is 

basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?",24
Ross," Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it 

says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I 

can pick something else up on the way.",35
Monica," Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? 

Short?",14
Monica," Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...",13
Phoebe, This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.,12
Chandler," It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over 

some puppies.",14
Chandler," Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over 

here, please?",15
Chandler," Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another 

latte?",12
Chandler," 

Going? Things aren’t going. She got me socks. (shows them to Phoebe)",12
Phoebe," Oh 

these go with your Rockys.  My God, she must really care about you. (sees the 

look on Chandler’s face and quickly says….) I’m sorry!",25
Rachel, But I saved it. I put my basket on top.,10
Rachel," Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.",10
Ross," No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. (to woman) This is my 

friend's machine.",15
Ross," Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it. ",11
Ross," (to the crowd in the laundromat) All right, show's over. Nothing 

to see here. (to Rachel) Ok, let's do laundry.",20
Ross," Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, 

uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.",19
Rachel," Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I 

supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants? ",28
Rachel," Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you 

caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.",18
Ross," Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, 

basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole another machine 

for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your 

bras and your under-panty things.",46
Rachel," (holds a pair of panties in front of Ross) Ok, Well, what 

about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?",25
Ross," (visibly nervous) Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.",11
Monica," (to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you 

guys grow up?",17
Joey, I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.,12
Joey," You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? 

That cute nibbly noise when she eats, like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.",28
Joey," Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. 

Sexually.",14
Monica," It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has 

an emotional age beyond, like eight.",21
Monica, Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.,12
Phoebe," Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. 

Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed. 

Go, go!",25
Chandler," Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should 

go out anymore. Janice.",16
Chandler," 

What fear of commitment?! I don’t have a fear of commitment!",11
Rachel," Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that 

if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't 

anything I can't do.",34
Ross," That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first 

time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the 

washer goes off) I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens 

up the washer) Uh-oh.",47
Ross," (not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. 

It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the 

laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh. ",28
Ross," All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with 

all your whites, and now…everything's kinda pink.",21
Ross," Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm 

sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.",22
Rachel," Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look 

like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's 

right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!",39
Monica," Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his 

head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, 

and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my 

eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please? ",49
Monica," Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in 

Appalachia.",12
Joey," Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.",10
Monica," Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's—not really 

true, is it?",12
Joey," All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a 

little.",15
Joey," Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.",12
Joey," Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the 

two of us, we can break them up.",19
Monica," I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop 

laughing at your Norman Mailer story.",19
Joey," Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.",10
Chandler," Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're 

different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, (Chandler 

flails his hand out and hits Janice in the eye)... boom.",35
Chandler," (to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This 

is the worst break-up in the history of the world. ",25
Phoebe," Oh my god. (Chandler downs another espresso.) How many of 

those have you had?",14
Phoebe," Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la 

la la.",15
Ross, You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.,10
Rachel," I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is 

our cart.",14
Rachel," All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna 

have to take me with it! ",17
Ross," Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his 

head on an open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine.",23
Phoebe," (seeing Rachel's clothes) What a neat idea. All your clothes 

match. I'm gonna do this.",15
Monica," We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for 

ourselves.",11
Ross," What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.",10
Rachel," (reading the program) Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's 

Joey's picture! This is so exciting!",15
Chandler," You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his 

plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...",21
Ross," 

(pulls a notice out of the program) Look, the a- role of “man number 3 will 

not be played by Vic Shapiro.” Well, we came on the wrong night.


",29
Phoebe," I don’t know. The exclamation 

point in the title scares me. (Gesturing) Y'know, it's not just Freud, 

it's Freud!",19
Joey," Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have 

to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.)

",27
Monica," Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off 

their body, to have something else to do?",20
Chandler," (staring at a woman across the room) Ross, ten o'clock.",10
Chandler," (sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at 

eight, nine, ten o'clock!",14
Chandler," She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look 

like short, fat, bald men!",16
Chandler," Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. 

Blarrglarrghh.'",12
Chandler," Oh please, could she be more out of my 

league? Ross, back me up here.",15
Ross, He could never get a woman like that in a million years.,12
Phoebe," Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful 

women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.",23
Chandler," Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm 

very very aware of my tongue...",16
Chandler," I can do this! Here goes. 

(He walks over to her but just stands there.)",15
Chandler," Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! 

Chandler is my name, and, uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi.",18
Chandler," Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about 

to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me 

sometime, thankyou, goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him 

back.) ",45
Joey," C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that 

thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.",26
Joey," Hey, 

hey about that German (speaking with the accent) accent?",10
Chandler," (running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful 

play, man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she 

pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. 

(To Joey) Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card 

out of his pocket.)",58
Joey," The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its 

card! Maybe they wanna sign me!",17
Joey," Hi, 

um- I’m here to see (reading the card) Estelle Leonard",11
Joey," 

(sits) Miss Leonard I can’t tell you how excited I am just to even be here.",16
Joey," Oh 

Miss Leonard…… (gets up to shake her hand but knocks over her pencil holder. He 

tries to pick it up but ends up spilling her drink.)",27
Ross," 

(grabs back the book) Where’s the Statue of Liberty?! Where?!",10
Phoebe," 

 Right there! (points to it) God, I can’t not see it now.


",12
Ross," 

(shows Chandler the book) Come here. Do you see anything right here?",12
Chandler,"
Yeah, right there in front of the Statue of 

Liberty.  (Ross drops the book and gives up, while Monica and Phoebe put the 

book away) (sits down) Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven 

seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.",46
Chandler," It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's 

had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...",21
Chandler," Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it 

was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.",28
Chandler," We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more 

or less.",13
Chandler," So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband 

would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant 

leg you can count the change in my pocket?",35
Chandler," So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of 

a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a 

boyfriend?",26
Chandler," What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. 

Didn't you listen to the story?",16
Monica," Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How 

could you get involved with a woman like this?",21
Phoebe," Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?",11
Monica," What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's 

going out with someone else?",17
Joey," When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going 

out with more people than she is.",19
Phoebe," Y’ 

know, one time I went out with a guy who had just gotten divorced. And it was 

really hard. His kids liked me better than him.",27
Monica," 

Phoebe, what does this have to do with Chandler’s thing?",10
Phoebe," No, 

nothing.  But I didn’t have anything on that topic. (small pause) So I went 

another way.


",17
Ross," Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, 

anthropologically speaking-",13
Chandler, Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.,12
Rachel," Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even 

used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the 

bristles, I don't know what that's for.",34
Ross," Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.",10
Rachel," I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, 

it's an extra seat around the coffee table.",20
Monica," Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, 

let's see what it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to 

compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for 

a while.",43
Phoebe," (to Rachel) I can't believe you tried to move the green 

ottoman.",12
Chandler," Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, 

she'll scratch your eyes right out.",18
Phoebe," Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You 

were like, a little, y'know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!",21
Ross," Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll 

that wasn't raggedy!",16
Monica," Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organized. But hey, I can be a 

kook.",13
Ross," Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill 

arrives, but you don't pay it right away.",19
Ross," Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a 

notice.",13
Rachel," I’m not done yet! And I buy 

laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.",18
Monica," Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.

K, I would be fine with that.


",15
Chandler," Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no 

coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are 

inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...",36
Monica, STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?,10
Joey," (on phone) Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be 

there! (He hangs up and to all.) That was my agent. (He tosses and catches the 

phone.) My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!",43
Joey," Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became 

an actor! ""I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's 

out of order!""",29
Joey," ""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!""",12
Joey," ...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? 

He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.",21
Joey," C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, 

and that's big!",16
Chandler," Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve 

this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your 

way into show business.",27
Joey," Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break 

for me!",15
Ross," You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all 

to the big opening?",15
Joey," Whaddya think? Today's the big day! 

Have you got tweezers? I think I have a rogue hair.


",17
Monica," Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, 

just don't ever tell me what you did in there.",22
Monica, He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!,12
Chandler," C'mon, we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, 

and runs back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!",17
Chandler," Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a 

couple of things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.",24
Chandler," Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, 

y'know.. (He starts to raid the fridge.)",17
Chandler," No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know 

in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for 

the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. 

and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. 

Monica, can you help me with the door? (He has armloads of stuff.)",65
Monica," Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would 

remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do 

that. ",25
Joey," Could 

you see if they could warm it up in here?  I’m a little concerned about goose 

bumps.",18
Joey," (enters the shower) Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this 

great opportunity. Look I mean, listen, I know this is 

just a first step but I hope this…


",30
Joey," Right. Okay. Losing the robe. (He takes off the robe.) And the 

robe is lost.",15
Joey," Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I 

mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry 

here.",28
Joey, I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...,12
Chandler," No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how 

happy they are.",15
Chandler," Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (He kisses her and 

pulls her back down.)",13
Chandler," What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!",11
Chandler," I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when 

I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?",22
Chandler," Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled 

by Rick, Ethan and myself?",15
Chandler," Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.",11
Chandler," ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm 

two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's 

this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that 

Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's 

saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'",62
Chandler," I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't 

exactly let each other finish...",18
Monica," Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the 

new Al Pacino movie?",16
Joey," Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about 

this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...",26
Rachel," Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.",12
Joey," Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I 

finally get my shot, and I blow it!",20
Ross," Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you 

know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?",21
Phoebe," No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even 

think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for 

you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna 

run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey 

Tribbiani's ass!'.",65
Rachel," Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard 

manner?",10
Monica," Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (He 

goes to her room.)",14
Monica," (hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) If it 

bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is 

stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then 

everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put 

them back! ...I need help! (She buries her head in her pillow.) ",70
Rachel," Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is 

proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.",16
Phoebe," Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about 

that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. 

(plays a chord, then the lights go out) OK, thank you very much.",39
Rachel," Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city 

is blacked out!",13
Monica," Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of 

Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.",21
Monica," (into phone) Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who 

am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we 

talk about this later? OK. (hangs up)",30
Phoebe," Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my 

apartment and check on my grandma. (to Monica) What's my number? ",21
Chandler," Oh my God, it's her..that Victoria's 

Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.",11
Chandler," She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh 

my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (pause) Is 

it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the 

part to focus on, you idiot!",39
Chandler," Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw 

you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy. 
",20
Joey," Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and 

these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.",18
Phoebe," (at window) Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a 

bunch of candles.",12
Chandler," Alright, alright, alright. It's been 

fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do 

something. Just make contact, smile!",26
Chandler," Yeah! That a 

boy, a word. That wasn't so hard. ""Mothers"", ""Yeah"" ""Mothers"", ""Yeah"". Work it.

(Smiles again at Jill) Don't smile!",22
Chandler," Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school 

with. Yeah, thanks. (takes phone)",14
Chandler," Yeah, I'm fine. (trying to cover up what he 

is saying) I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.",20
Joey," (to everyone) Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM 

vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (on phone) Chandler, listen. (says something 

intentionally garbled)",22
Monica," OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a 

pool table.",12
Joey," OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the 

women's room on the second floor of the New York City public library.",22
Monica, Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?,10
Phoebe," Oh... Milwaukee. 

(Everybody is easily confused). What? It's a really weird place.",12
Ross," The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind 

a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we 

were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom. 
So that would leave....",37
Rachel," Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to 

be... (sigh)... oh, the foot of the bed. ",16
Phoebe," Oh, this must be what 

the fridge looks like with the door is closed. Spooky...(walks out of the 

kitchen)",19
Rachel," I just never had a relationship with that kind 

of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle 

of a theme park.",28
Ross," Well, it was the only thing to do there that 

didn't have a line.",14
Rachel," There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me 

on a miniature golf course. ",13
Rachel," No, he said we were holding up the people 

behind us.",11
Rachel," I mean, do you think there are people who go 

through life never having that kind of...",17
Ross," But you know, I'll tell you something. 

Passion is way overrated. ",11
Ross," It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But 

hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the 

case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss 

out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.",48
Ross," But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.",10
Rachel," Oh Ross, you're so great. (she playfully rubs 

his head and gets up)",13
Joey," Because you waited too long to make your move, 

and now you're in the friend zone. ",16
Ross," I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the 

groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...",22
Joey," Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has 

no idea what you're thinking. ",13
Ross," Oh yeah? She just ran 

her fingers through my hair. Were you missing that interaction?",15
Joey," 

No-no-no-no. This is running fingers through your hair. (Demonstrates). Kay? Now 

this (lightly touches Ross' hair)...is a tousle. Look, if 

you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.",36
Ross," I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right 

moment. (Joey looks at him) What? What, now?",18
Joey," Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? 

The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I 

think that...' (Rachel comes into the room behind them)",32
Ross," We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear 

something. Listen. (everyone is silent) Don't you hear that?",16
Phoebe," (singing) New York City has no power, and the 

milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from 

dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... (she writes the lyrics down)",38
Joey," OK. (Ross goes out on the balcony to talk to 

Rachel)",11
Joey," OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever 

tell Ross that I told you.",15
Phoebe," This is so typical. I'm always the last one to 

know everything.",12
Phoebe," Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when 

Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when 

you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. (Monica gestures at Phoebe to 

shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased) Looks like I was second to last.",56
Joey," (looks at Monica 

seductively and starts walking up to her) You a-you had a crush on me?",17
Monica," All right, it wasn't 

a crush. It was a....a dent.",10
Monica," All right. Look, you 

were moving your furniture upstairs. I-I thought you had nice arms. (touches his 

right arm lightly) That's all! (goes to sit on the couch in the living room)",32
Joey," Nice arms, huh? Hey, 

Mon. (picks up a chair) I'm moving the chair. Do anything for ya?",17
Ross," You know, with all the 

lights out, you can actually see the stars. (laughs a little)",16
Ross," OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not 

so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.",20
Ross," OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting 

to, um....",12
Rachel," Oh, look at the little cat! (a small kitten is 

on the roof behind Ross)",15
Phoebe," Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We 

should find his owner.",13
Ross," Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in 

the hall?",12
Chandler," All 

right, all right. Damage control. Get back to the gum. You 

know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (Jill gives him a stick of 

gum, and a strange look) 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be 

perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but 

no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.",64
Rachel," (stops at a door) Oh no, the Mendels, they hate 

all living things, right?",14
Phoebe," Oh. (they knock at the next door, Mr. Heckles 

answers) Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.",22
Phoebe," (trying to hold back the struggling cat) He 

seems to hate you. Are you sure?",15
Phoebe," (the cat runs away from her) Oooh! You are a 

very bad man!",13
Rachel," Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did 

you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...",12
Joey," Hey Mon, wanna go for a 

ride in my race car? (seductively) I'll bring my arms.",16
Monica," That'd be nice. Then 

we could bring my wheelbarrow to carry your teeth.",13
Rachel," (entering with Paolo, arm in arm) Everybody, 

this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.",21
Ross," No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. 

Into our lives.",11
Rachel," Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be 

Paolo's cat!",11
Ross," That, that is funny... (to Joey).... and Rachel 

keeps touching him.",11
Phoebe," Alright. I looked all over the building and I 

couldn't find the kitty anywhere.",14
Phoebe," Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And 

I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.",19
Chandler," (chewing gum) Ah, let's see. What next? 

Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we 

go.",23
Chandler," Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need 

to do is reach over and put it back in my mouth. (Chandler slyly grabs the 

gum from the wall and slides it back in his mouth.)",36
Chandler," Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... 

(grimacing) ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. 

Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking. ",28
Ross," (mocking Paolo) Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... 

blah blaaaaaah....",10
Rachel," (to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God, you guys, 

what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!",21
Phoebe," I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. 

(Rachel looks at her) But I won't.",17
Rachel," God, the first time he smiled at me... those 

three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.",21
Phoebe," You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've 

heard... (they stare at her)... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.",23
Rachel," Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we 

have nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but 

Goooooooddddddd....",22
Ross," Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... 

know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.",16
Ross," No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... 

being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is 

that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in 

the.... um... ",39
Ross," No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you 

get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very 

sad.",27
Ross," That's funny, because you know, you are a huge 

crapweasel!",10
Phoebe," Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to 

burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... (time lapse)... minus 46, minus 47, minus 48.... 

(someone blows it out, the room gets completely dark)",32
Joey," Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to 

bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.",21
Chandler," Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your 

phone... and for saving my life.",14
Chandler," Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, 

I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.",27
Chandler," Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does 

it get better than this?",12
Chandler," Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 

'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...",13
Chandler," ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is 

that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?",20
Rachel," Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I 

thought maybe, possibly, you might be... ",18
Rachel," Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party 

talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.",19
Chandler," Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when 

you first met me?",17
Ross," Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan 

Sallidor did.",12
Ross," No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her 

too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked 

her, so...",30
Chandler," Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?",11
Chandler," Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?",11
Chandler," Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were 

gonna be vague about this.",17
Joey,"  Look 

Chandler I think this going to work for you.",10
Joey," Sure, 

sure. Women find you less threatening, they let their guard down, and BOOM, 

you’re like a…stealth heterosexual.


",18
Rachel," Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) Bon giorno, 

caro mio. ",12
Ross," (to Joey) So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta 

go to Rome.",16
Rachel," Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? 

Talking to Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I'm talking to Rome.",25
Monica," Hey dad, what's up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.",10
Ross," Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks 

like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.",24
Monica, The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. ,10
Ross," Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her 

Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.",24
Ross," Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now. ",10
Ross," Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, 

she's not, quite..",13
Chandler," I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?",10
Rachel," (exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's 

your hair.",11
Ross," I don’t know, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just 

don't feel, uh...",17
Phoebe," Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom 

died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? 

(She circles her hand around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, 

draws back nervously) Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got 

struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong 

Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss 

her.",82
Joey," Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, 

you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! (realizes his tactlessness) ...So 

Chandler looks gay, huh?",28
Phoebe," Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. (Hands back 

the pencil)",14
Monica," 

Great! (looking at a catalog) That would be the non-protective corrugate 

fiberboard with white laminate.  And we can’t bury Nana in dresser drawer from 

Ikea.",25
Monica," 

Dad, don’t you think this might be more about the fact that...once you make the 

decision, it’s like acknowledging Nana’s actually gone?",22
Monica," ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does 

sound fun.",14
Chandler," No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, 

apparently other people have made the same mistake.",17
Chandler," So, uh... what do you think it is about me?",10
Chandler," Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me 

with?",10
Chandler," No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up 

with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.",28
Chandler," Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I 

could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.",22
Ross, (holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one?,10
Ross," I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother 

to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.",24
Ross," Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. (Starts to climb over the 

furniture)",13
Ross," (forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the 

burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.",24
Ross," No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.",12
Monica," Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my 

hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?",24
Phoebe," (entering) Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.",10
Chandler," Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like 

that, isn't it?",13
Chandler," Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent 

Muss Berger.",10
Joey," No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.",11
Ross," I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone 

there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- (Not looking 

where he is going he falls into an open grave)",32
Phoebe," Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in 

spasm...huh.",13
Chandler," Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.",11
Ross," Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you 

guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs... 

(Hugs her)",29
Ross," I love you man. (hugs him) And 

listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.",20
Ross," Rachel. Rachel Rachel. (Sits down beside her)

Oh I do love you.",12
Ross, Oh.. you don't get it! (Passes out and slumps across her),11
Joey," (hides the TV, but he still has an earphone) Just a, uh... 

hearing disability.",14
Rachel," (still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a 

cracker?",12
Monica," Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.",10
Monica," That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do 

it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?",30
Monica," How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like 

your hair... for example.",15
Monica," Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told 

her the truth?",15
Monica,"  Oh 

look this is my first grade picture. Oh, please ignore the “Dy-no-mite!” 

t-shirt.",14
Ross," Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?",12
Monica," Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 

'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'. ",18
Rachel," Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was 

she there?",13
Ross, Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile),13
Ross," (looking) Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying 

something.",12
Chandler," Good, good. Listen, heh, I don’t know what Shelley told you 

about me, but, uh... I'm not.",17
Chandler," Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind 

him) If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian.",29
Rachel," Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but 

I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my 

salary?",32
Rachel," It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, 

every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but 

I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why 

I took this job.",45
Rachel," Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but 

I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody 

need coffee? (everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that.",42
Rachel," Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just 

wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance 

on my tips?",30
Rachel," Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill 

before. (picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go. ",22
Monica," Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico 

for Thanksgiving?",15
Chandler," And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing 

makeup?",10
Joey," Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor 

slash model.",14
Chandler," That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like 

Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.",16
Monica," Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those ""healthy, healthy, 

healthy guys""?",13
Joey," No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers) ",11
Ross," (to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, 

huh? It's Thanksgiving. ",16
Monica," Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? 

I'll make it just like Mom's.",19
Monica," You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks 

at her sheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?",23
Monica," And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the 

pilgrim holidays.",12
Phoebe," Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in 

December 'cause he is lunar.",14
Monica," Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?",11
Rachel," Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two 

dollars to go.",12
Ross," (mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will 

probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.",19
Ross," Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, 

but...",15
Ross," Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get 

it back to the museum.",18
Ross," Ok. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of 

books about bein' a lesbian.",17
Ross," (picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.",11
Ross," The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean 

you're... crazy?",14
Ross," You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?",12
Ross," Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get 

some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.",24
Phoebe," Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear 

everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put 

your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear 

everything we say.",42
Chandler," I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this 

experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.",21
Rachel," No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, 

forget shoop, shoop, shoop.",14
Monica," (hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your 

traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese 

fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.",29
Rachel," Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for 

Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday? ",21
Chandler," We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I 

have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is 

the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.",32
Chandler," Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner 

once you've seen it in reverse.",15
Ross," 

(picks up a yam) Ohhh, what’s this? I never saw this at mom’s",13
Ross," 

Hello? This isn’t a yam. Yam comes in a….purple cans. They don’t-they don’t come 

in these.


",16
Phoebe," K, 

Ross don’t take this the wrong way or anything but…Back off!",12
Joey," Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the 

Aramis guy. (pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis? ",20
Joey, I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.,10
Joey," I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to 

lay back.",13
Joey," Huhh. Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?",11
Phoebe," No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be 

infectious.",12
Joey," Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I 

have VD.",12
Monica," Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams 

are yamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What?",16
Ross, I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.,13
Monica," All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way 

and stop annoying me.",17
Rachel," I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, 

shoop, shoop, shoop.",15
Chandler," No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this 

merriment.",12
Chandler," Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but 

that's not funny anymore.",16
Joey," Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.",12
Joey," But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a 

little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's 

bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.",40
Monica," All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with 

lumps, and in the form of tots.",17
Monica," What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!",10
Phoebe," Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them 

whipped and then add some peas and onions.",20
Phoebe," Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you 

know, before she died.",17
Rachel," Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to 

leave, and hits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!",21
Chandler," The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just 

gotten away.",11
Chandler," No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. 

It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free 

and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's 

with me?",39
Chandler," Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. 

How often does that happen?",16
Ross," Ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, 

where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to 

offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...",35
Ross," Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. 

Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.",22
Rachel," I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all 

over the park.",16
Phoebe," Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was 

just mean.",15
Monica," Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the 

outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?",21
Rachel, We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.,12
Rachel," Yes, you do. When we left, you said, ""got the keys.""",11
Ross," And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta 

pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what 

I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't 

have gills anymore.",44
Ross," Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?",10
Ross," Shh! (singing) Here we come, walkin' down the street, get 

the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! (to Carol) Hey, uh, 

did you just feel that?",28
Ross," (singing) Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet 

you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.",29
Ross," (singing) Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any 

breasts.",12
Rachel," 

 Oh, this is just really great! 5 o’clock, my plane is pulling away from the 

gate.",16
Phoebe," K, 

look if I’m going to try to cheer you up, you’re going to have to meet me half 

way.",20
Joey," Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the 

math.",14
Monica, Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?,11
Rachel," (grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it 

wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman 

do this (makes a gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But 

I'm not.",43
Rachel," No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the 

keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.",22
Phoebe," Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.",12
Rachel, Aside from the fact that you said you had them?,10
Monica," Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough 

that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a 

different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does 

anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) 

Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and 

it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...",75
Chandler," Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's 

open. Here we go.",16
Joey,"  All 

right, Chandler don’t lose this. (throws it do the drawer with all the other 

zillion keys)",17
Monica," Well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, 

potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.",15
Ross," Here we come, walkin' down the—this doesn't smell like Mom's.",10
Monica," No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up 

the pan of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.",26
Ross," Oh 

don’t yell at me, you’re the one who burnt dinner.",11
Rachel," Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like 

I'm stuck here with you guys.",19
Joey," Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.",11
Monica," Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious 

Thanksgiving dinner?",15
Phoebe," Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. (Everyone 

is less than enthused). Oh he’s adding gravy. 

Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly 

Naked Gal.",35
Chandler," Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?",10
Phoebe," Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. 

What'd you wish for?",15
Chandler," I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I 

know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for 

me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve 

divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd 

gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have 

syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm 

trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.",98
Phoebe," Oh 

and look Ugly Naked Guy is hanging candy canes.  (Rachel runs up to the window)",16
Rachel," 

 Where? (Phoebe points) Ohhh, wow (not sure what to make of it)…that’s festive.


",13
Phoebe," That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child 

Bethel?",13
Monica," Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?",11
Ross," Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...",11
Ross," Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a 

roommate is kinda pathet- (Realizes) ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which 

is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.",30
Phoebe," So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve 

new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.",23
Ross, How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.,11
Joey," I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's 

not even jolly, it's all political.",17
Joey," Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in 

the face, y'know?",17
Rachel," Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They 

all protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New 

Year's?",27
Rachel," Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New 

Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. ",24
Ross," (like 

a detective) It’s perfect. We’ll put it between lunch and breakfast. (does 

popping sound with lips)",17
Chandler," It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark 

holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.",30
Rachel," (Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by 

popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!",15
Phoebe," Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm 

playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!",22
Chandler," (Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!",11
Phoebe," Okay, we're gonna take a short break. (Goes over to their 

table)",12
Joey," Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!",10
Rachel," Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, 

by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! 

...Ooh. Did I just share too much?",34
Phoebe, Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?,12
Phoebe," Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, 

except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with 

him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...

",41
Chandler," Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, 

you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you? You're gonna break the pact. 

She's gonna break the pact.",31
Phoebe," No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?",10
Chandler," I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I 

snapped.",11
Monica," Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in 

history!",11
Chandler," I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!",12
Joey," Nice shoes, huh? (He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)",11
Ross," I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first 

fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some 

things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some feces...",39
Chandler," Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him 

for you.",14
Ross," Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems 

like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favor to 

me.",31
Chandler," Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.",10
Phoebe," Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, 

you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.",21
Phoebe," Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just 

sweep and throw me. ",17
Ross," So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean 

to you?",14
Monica," I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and 

Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.",19
Rachel," (Brings Joey a mug of coffee) Okay, here we go...",10
Rachel," (Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee) There. Now there 

is.",12
Ross," Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.",12
Joey," Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's 

an elf to do?",17
Ross," Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the 

ball drops?",15
Rachel," Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll 

know who's with who.",15
Ross," Yeah, well I’ll know. Hey, 

y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.",15
Ross," Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He’s angry with 

me again. I have no idea why. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's 

walking around all the time dragging his hands... ",28
Chandler," That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other 

night.",13
Chandler," Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is 

amazing.",11
Chandler, With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.,10
Chandler," Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up 

socks... and a melon...",15
Chandler," 

 And if you’re going to do Minsk, y’know, that’s the only way to go.",14
Phoebe," Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so (Puts on a fake cheery 

voice) congratulations! This is so exciting!",19
Joey," Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a 

younger girl)...You brought your kids.",18
Ross," 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me 

ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be 

welcome in your home?",32
Monica," I'm thinking your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee 

table.",11
Ross," Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And 

for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...",25
Ross," Thank you. (She walks off) C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I 

do a little mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you 

later.",27
Monica," Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?",10
Rachel," No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this 

woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something 

about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- 

starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and 

three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And 

I hit my head on the curb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having 

fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?",101
Rachel," 
It’s hard for me to tell. My eye’s closing up. 

",10
Monica," 

 Let me get it for ya. (pencils in on her lip) Ok.",12
Rachel,"  Ok 

here we go! Screw Paolo. Screw that psycho cab lady. It’s New Years Eve.  Let’s 

have a good time.


",20
Monica," Ok. 

All right there you go. (Rachel walks the wrong way.) No this way.  You’re fine. 

There you go.


",19
Ross," (Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm 

not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.",27
Rachel," 

(walks up to a guy) Hi. I’m Rachel. So whose friend are you? (takes a sip of her 

drink but ends up leaking onto her chest. She laughs it off.) Look at me! 

Spilling everywhere. Huh….


",36
Monica," 

 Bobby? Fun Bobby?  Let me talk to you for just a sec. (Bobby gets up and both 

him and Monica walk away from everyone else.)   Umm, look a..I recently lost a 

grandparent myself, so I’m really know exactly how you feel. But a…you’re 

really bringing the party down.


",48
Monica," 

(interrupts) Yeah, yeah ok.  (places a noisemaker in his mouth) There you go. 

(He blows the noisemaker unhappily.) There you go!",21
Chandler," Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, 

when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that 

we-",24
Chandler," Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)",10
Phoebe," Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't 

stay here just 'cause of me.",19
Phoebe," Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my 

life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! 

How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I 

have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I 

can't understand that!'.",65
Phoebe," Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And 

then you put your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me 

that you love me and you'll never forget me.",39
Phoebe," And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go 

because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. (They 

kiss) I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.",37
Chandler," (To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the 

peacock bit me. (Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)",23
Chandler," Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in 

Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at 

that, I did know how to tell you.",34
Chandler," Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no 

math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. 

(Makes kiss noise)",30
Phoebe, I don’t know. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.,10
Chandler," Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! 

Somebody kiss me!",12
Ross," (Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so 

much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but 

he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love 

so much doesn't love you back. Y’know?",49
Phoebe," Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.",10
Monica," Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don't 

look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and 

plunge us into a pit of depression. ",35
Monica," No it’s mine. And why did I 

'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and 

say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?",31
Phoebe," I just wish there was something we could do. (Bends down and 

talks to him) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!",27
Phoebe," I 

know. I hate that they are calling him John Doe.  How sad! It’s like he’s a 

deer, a female deer…(Monica stops her) Oh I was going to stop.


",29
Monica," Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. ",11
Phoebe," Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means 

he's artistic.",14
Monica," Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- 

he can dance!",14
Phoebe," Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's 

listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what 

you look like naked.",27
Ross," I 

don’t get it. You guys don’t even know this guy.",11
Chandler,"  Yeah. Are there no 

conscious men in the city for you two?",12
Joey, I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.,11
Rachel," Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! (Turns on the TV)",11
Chandler," Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's 

is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.",16
Chandler," Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit 

in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?",15
Rachel," Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love 

her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!",28
Chandler," Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven 

years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'",25
Joey," Oh 

yeah the thing after the opera with the girl with the trick hip. Huh? (Chandler 

looks at him. So he stops.)


",22
Ross," C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.",11
Ross," Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... 

Just a dream I had- but, phew.",20
Chandler, This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.,13
Monica," Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction 

bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was 

forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.",28
Chandler," Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a 

little.",14
Ross," (Entering) What is this dive? Only you could've picked this 

place.",11
Rachel," Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost 

track of time.",14
Rachel," Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've 

ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I 

wanted to do was become a writer.",34
Ross," Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (A woman emerges from the toilet 

behind him and he tries to pretend he was in the other one)",24
Ross," Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... 

(Joey shakes his head) Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell 

Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?",38
Joey," You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' 

aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!",20
Ross," Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early 

morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.",20
Ross," No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was 

supposed to bring me one.",15
Joey," Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.",10
Chandler," Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes 

back inside and shuts the door)",16
Ross," I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, 

y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...",18
Joey," I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in 

her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?",24
Ross," Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...",10
Ross," No, I’m not going to tell him. 

Why would I tell him?",12
Phoebe," Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... 

that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?",20
Monica," I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the 

way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?",22
Phoebe," No. (Monica brushes Coma Guy's hair in the other direction) 

No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?",26
Phoebe," Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! (Whips back the 

sheet to reveal him wearing new pajamas.)",18
Ross," Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to 

drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... (He has caught sight of 

Joey scowling at him) I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed 

your mom.",49
Ross," I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too 

much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, 

and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-",39
Chandler," I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!",12
Joey," Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else 

who knows what would have happened.",19
Chandler," (To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you 

thinking?",12
Chandler," Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go 

through with my mom more than you. ",18
Chandler, I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door),10
Chandler, You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door),11
Joey," (Shouting after him) Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! (To 

Ross) See what happens when you break the code?",20
Joey, Ah! (Points to door) Huh? (Leaves and slams the door),10
Rachel," Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first 

chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim 

prison'?",27
Monica," (Reads) Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.",11
Phoebe," Okay, maybe it was a trick question. (Plays a few chords) Um, 

Rachel can we do this now?",18
Joey," (To Ross, on the couch) Now, here's a picture of my mother and 

father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.",26
Joey," C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.",10
Rachel," (Into microphone) Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe 

Buffay.",11
Chandler," Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, all right there, 

Mother-Kisser? (Goes to the counter)",16
Ross," Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at 

me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets 

of lips.",30
Chandler," Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a 

Freudian nightmare. ",14
Ross," Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say 

something?",13
Chandler," Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my 

mom!",10
Ross, (To the rest of Central Perk) We're rehearsing a Greek play.,11
Ross," No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not 

gonna tell her how you feel?",18
Chandler," That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil 

tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. All right? Trust me, you can't 

talk to her.",28
Ross," Okay, 'you' can't, or (Points to Chandler) you can't? (Chandler 

grabs his finger) Okay, that's my finger. (Chandler twists it and Ross goes down 

on one knee) That's, that's my knee. (To Central Perk) Still doing the play. 

Aaah!",39
Monica," Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, ""That was nice?"" It something to 

me? ""I'll call you?"" ",16
Monica," This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. 

And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you 

wake up, and ""See you around!"" Let's go, Phoebe.",37
Phoebe," Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was 

just the coma.",15
Chandler, You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.,10
Ross," Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.",10
Joey," Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, 

about everything.",16
Joey," No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a 

mom?""",15
Joey," Then she came back with ""The question is, when are you gonna 

grow up and realize I have a bomb?""",20
Ross," 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say ""When are you 

gonna grow up and realize I am your mom?""",22
Joey," I don’t know, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! 

(Goes back to the door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks 

through the spy hole)",30
Joey," Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. 

They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're 

coming right at us! Run! Run!",27
Chandler," Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.",10
Ross," Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me 

kissing your mom, uh? Huh? (Wags his finger at Chandler, then puts it down) 

But.. we don't have to go down that road.",35
Rachel," Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your 

absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her 

heaving beasts'.",28
Rachel," All right, all right, so I'm not a great typist...",10
Ross," Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? 

Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!",25
Phoebe,"  Oh 

wait, wait, wait, no. I just got to the part about her ‘public hair’.


",15
Monica," Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if 

you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. 

(pauses, listens to person on phone) Well, the meat's only every third layer, 

maybe you could scrape.",39
Ross," Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's 

uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! (snaps 

fingers)",28
Phoebe," Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people 

actually eat the placenta. (Joey grimaces)",18
Chandler," And, we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)",11
Phoebe," (softly) Sorry. (Camera pans back to Monica, still on phone)",10
Monica," Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do 

you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? (listens to Aunt Syl on phone, looks 

shocked) Nice talk, Aunt Syl. (in New York accent) You kiss Uncle Freddie with 

that mouth?",47
Joey," Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this 

big? (measures about 2 inches with his thumb and index finger) This is your 

baby. (in baby-like voice) Hi Daddy! ",32
Joey," (in baby-like voice) How come you don't live with 

Mommy? (pause; shows Ross less than amused) How come Mommy lives with that other 

lady? (pause; Ross still looks less than amused; Joey smiling) What's a lesbian? 

(playfully hits Ross)",39
Rachel," Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos 

(touching Paolo's nose with forefinger with each syllable)",18
Rachel," Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.",10
Ross," Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it 

be...(makes flinging motions with hands) flung by now?",19
Rachel," I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling 

things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, 

when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...",35
Ross," ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, 

huh? Call immigration? (pauses, looks suddenly inspired) I could call 

immigration!",21
Rachel," 

What? (Her, Monica, and Phoebe come over.) Oh look. Ugly Naked Guy is making 

shadow puppets",16
Ross," (to 

the guys who are eager to look) Go! Go!


",10
Joey," I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little 

baby toes, and their little baby hands... ",18
Ross," Hey, hello! mmwa! (kisses Carol) I brought all the books, and 

Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna. ",19
Ross," (pauses) I'm pretty sure that it is...(looks 

at Carol’s figure) Ha ha oooh. Ohhh. 19 weeks and the breasts are starting to 

swell…..according to the literature.",26
Ross," (making flinging gestures with hands) Oh, tell me, 

tell me, is everything, uhh....? ",13
Ross," Oh, that's great, that is great! (Hugs and kisses Carol. Then 

picks up a picture frame)",16
Ross," (surprised, chuckling nervously) Of course it's your 

friend Tanya. (looks up frightened)",12
Ross," (chuckles nervously) The sex? (chuckles) Um, I'm 

having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw 

in Tanya (miming washing hair, that's the best I could think of), yaw...",34
Ross," Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!",10
Ross," No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I 

think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, 

there it is! (pauses) Or isn't...",35
Ross," (flailing arms in protest) Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, 

hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!",21
Ross," Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be? ",12
Ross," (interrupts) No, no, no I don't want to know, don't 

want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go. ",24
Ross," No problem, ok, mmmwa (kisses Carol) oh, mmmwa (kisses Carol's 

stomach, then punches Susan's shoulder) Susan... (Ross leaves.)",18
Ross," (on intercom) Uh, never mind, I don't want to know. 

(Carol and Susan laugh)",14
Chandler," Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a 

new one?",16
Chandler," What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!",12
Chandler," Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your 

little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio",17
Chandler," Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter 

left little to the imagination.",16
Chandler," Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of 

us wants to move out?",17
Chandler," Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...",10
Chandler," It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran 

off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.",21
Phoebe," Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get 

started.",13
Phoebe," Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, 

you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!",19
Rachel," (to Ross) I can't believe you don't want to know. I 

mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and 

Susan knows.... ",29
Ross," Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!",10
Monica," Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told 

me.",14
Joey," So what's it gonna be? (Monica whispers in Joey's ear. Ross gets 

up and waves arms frantically in protest)",19
Ross," Wait—oh—hey—huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!",10
Chandler," 

Well you could use some of my sorts. I rarely use them.


",12
Joey," Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.",10
Phoebe," Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was 

fine until. (A flashback starts Paolo, lying on massage table, moving his hands 

up Phoebe's legs.)",26
Ross," You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral 

obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? 

(waiting for guys to chime in)",34
Joey," Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? 

(points to a table)",16
Joey," So what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm 

outside again?"" Of course!",16
Joey," I don't know, birds just don't say, ""Hello, sit here, eat 

something.""",12
Chandler," Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest 

fine dining!",13
Joey," Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!",10
Chandler," Not like that, I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the 

birds! (Joey turns and gives Chandler a dirty look)",20
Rachel," No, these aren't all my suitcases. (picks up small blue 

suitcase and shows to Phoebe) This one's Paolo's.",18
Rachel," Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way 

over.",11
Phoebe," Ok, um, (clears throat) we haven't known each other for that 

long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, 

my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, 

I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. (Phoebe opens a tin and 

offers Rachel a cookie)",62
Rachel," (taking cookie) Ok, thanks Pheebs (takes bite of 

cookie, overwhelmed) Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!",20
Phoebe," Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to 

the other cookies",17
Rachel," All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal 

cookies I've ever had.",14
Ross, I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.,10
Monica," So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on 

these little guys' heads?",16
Joey," Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!",11
Monica," Heads up Ross! (Monica scores on Chandler and Joey) Score! 

(points at Chandler) You suck!",15
Phoebe," Ok, I've got milk (takes thermos from her bag and starts to 

pour a cup) Here you go... (Rachel drinks straight from thermos) Oh!(Rachel 

finishes thermos) Better?",27
Rachel," No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about 

the other day with you guys and I was all ""Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me 

feel so..."" (pulls a lot of the roll of paper towel out) Oh, God, I'm so 

embarrassed!",44
Rachel," Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!",12
Rachel," (voice wavers) Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see 

this?",14
Phoebe," (raises hand) Oh! I know! (Rachel startled) It's because... 

he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...",20
Rachel," No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. 

Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...",22
Phoebe," I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there 

right now, so...",15
Monica," We should get over there and see if she's okay. 

(switching places with Ross) Just one...second! Score! (Monica scores, 

high-fives with Ross) Game! Come on. (Monica and Phoebe leave)",29
Ross," (wiping his brow) Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we 

kicked your butts.",12
Joey," No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic 

standing-there team.",13
Chandler," What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the 

guy; it's time for you to swoop in!",20
Joey," Yes, now is when you swoop! You got to make sure that when Paolo 

walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's got to know that 

you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!",39
Chandler," My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there 

for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross 

and Chandler look off into the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking 

at, looks in the same direction)",45
Monica," Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off 

the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel 

gesturing with hands in front of her chest), Ok, that is either, ""How could 

you?"" or, ""Enormous breasts!"" Here he comes! ",44
Monica," Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands 

him a lasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the 

cheese bubbles.",31
Ross," Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for 

everyone when I say... (shuts door in his face and walks away)",25
Phoebe," Oh, just look at her... (girls move toward Rachel on the 

balcony)",12
Ross," Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there 

so she's not overwhelmed...",18
Ross, (pulls Monica back) ...and I really think it should be me.,11
Rachel," Ooh, I've been better. I can’t 

believe this. I wasn’t supposed to care about 

this guy. Y’know, it just supposed to be this big fun Italian thing. Y’know, 

some day I could look back on it and say ‘Hey, that was a big fun Italian 

thing!’ It wasn’t supposed to feel like this when it was over. (exhales)


",58
Ross," Come here. (he hugs Rachel) Listen, you deserve so much better 

than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what 

he has when he has you.",33
Rachel," I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I 

don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. 

(Ross crosses arms)",34
Ross," See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys 

altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to 

develop a more sophisticated screening process.",32
Rachel," No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just 

got to figure out what I want",22
Ross," Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a 

Paolo.",14
Rachel," No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going 

to grow up to be one.",20
Rachel," Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.",10
Ross," Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a 

boy?",13
Monica," Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!",10
Monica," You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll 

only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) 

All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) and I'm gone.",42
Rachel," That is it! You just barge in here, you don't 

knock",11
Chandler," That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... 

nipular areas.",13
Phoebe," Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who 

thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she 

takes a shower.",27
Phoebe," Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.",11
Rachel, He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.,11
Phoebe," I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a 

shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?",18
Phoebe," Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, 

y'know? Vinyl.",15
Rachel," Okaaay. (To the guys, on the couch) Any of you guys want 

anything else?",14
Rachel," No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?",10
Ross, You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?,10
Chandler," It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a 

telescope and a box of donuts.",19
Phoebe," Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her 

breasts.",12
Rachel," Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.",10
Monica," Hey 

I always liked ‘bazoombas.’  Gives them a Latin spin.",10
Chandler," Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were 

very nice boobies.",13
Rachel," Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are 

nice.",13
Chandler," Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?",11
Joey," Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?",10
Joey," (Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with 

Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn't Ma?",25
Joey, Sure. So how long you been... (Goes back to chopping),10
Joey," Hey, 

you’re having an affair. I’m chopping garlic. It’s a wacky world.",12
Joey, You're one to talk. (Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan),10
Joey, Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.,10
Joey," It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was 

leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. 

(Considers) That'd be cool.... This blows!",33
Monica," (to 

Ross) Do you ever think dad cheated on mom?",10
Ross," Oh 

no. I don’t think so. ‘Cause that would involve having sex, and I would like to 

think that our parents don’t do that sort of thing.


",27
Rachel," I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She 

walks over near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do 

they have to become people? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can't you 

stop staring at my breasts?",45
Rachel, Did you not get a good enough look the other day?,11
Ross," All right, all right. We're all adults here, there's only one 

way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have 

to show her your pee pee.",32
Chandler," Oh, it's nothing; it's a little thing... I hate that guy.",11
Ross," What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? 

C'mon, he's not that bad.",17
Ross," Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I 

thought on any level that-that she was a lesbian?",21
Ross, That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!,10
Monica," Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But 

maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking 

you better!",30
Ross," Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!",10
Rachel," You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, 

but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which 

had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in. 

And-and mom just gave it all away.


",43
Chandler," Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?",12
Chandler," Joey, if I go first, I want to be looking for my keys.",13
Joey," If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right 

here where I can keep an eye on you.",22
Joey," That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long 

as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no 

sleeping with your girlfriend.",32
Joey," Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in 

Chandler's room.",15
Chandler," 

Oooh, bunking up. If you smell ‘smores, don’t be alarmed.",10
Chandler," C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird 

when it's not followed by ""No thanks, it's late."" ",20
Joey," Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta 

make a change. Six years is long enough.",19
Joey, Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!,11
Joey, I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!,10
Joey," Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.

",11
Joey," I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on 

top of girls...",14
Joey," Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all 

these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able 

to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, 

thinking...",44
Chandler," Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you 

to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?",22
Chandler," No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. 

Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the 

right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No 

thanks, I'm married.""",44
Rachel," Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in 

the shower?",13
Rachel," Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's pee pee time. (She goes 

into Joey and Chandler's apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) 

Hey, Mr. Trib. ",25
Joey, (Runs out in a towel) What's the matter with you?!,10
Rachel, You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!,13
Phoebe," Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to 

invite you guys.",16
Phoebe," Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just 

that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?",19
Joey," So then how could you I mean, how could you?!",10
Joey," Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are 

you talking about?! I mean, what about you?",20
Joey," Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.",11
Phoebe," 

 I’m sorry. I’m sorry.  Look, I have a thing. I have a thing, which means you 

can’t ever do that.",20
Phoebe," It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. 

They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.",22
Phoebe," But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They 

don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a 

little...",28
Joey," Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's 

gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little 

sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining 

order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.",51
Joey," Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you 

gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own 

mistakes.",27
Rachel," Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.",13
Chandler," If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond 

chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.",23
Phoebe," I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really 

sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that 

guy!",33
Ross," She barely knows me. We just live in the same 

building.",11
Chandler," Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game 

here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian—I don't 

think we need a third... ",28
Joey," Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still 

in the shell? Thanks.",14
Joey," Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, ""Here's 

your egg back, I'm returning your egg.""",17
Rachel," No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped 

the guy?",10
Phoebe," 'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little 

frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day! 

(Sits down on the couch) (To Joey and Chandler) Hi!",31
Monica," But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy 

any night of the year. I know I do. ",19
Joey," No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only 

reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her 

friend.",29
Chandler," Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such 

a...",10
Joey," Pathetic mess? I know, but—come on, man, she's 

needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. 

He picks it up and eats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman 

since Janice. You're doin' this.",42
Chandler," Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. 

Something crunches in Ross' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?",20
Joey," (Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) 

How do I look?",13
Chandler," Ok, now, remember, no trading. You 

get the pretty one, I get the mess.",14
Chandler," Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out 

the window. ",12
Joey," No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, 

forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down. ",18
Chandler," Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the 

woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!",20
Joey," (at the urinal) Can you stop yellin'? You're 

makin' me nervous......... and I can't go when I'm nervous.",18
Chandler," I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up 

right behind Joey and yells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!",25
Rachel," Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing 

compared to Pete Carney.",13
Rachel," Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to 

cry every time we had sex. (imitating) ""Was it good for you?""",21
Monica," Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day 

over Howard-the-""I-win""-guy. (imitating) ""I win! I win!"" I went out with the guy 

for two months—I didn't get to win once.",30
Rachel," How did we end up with these jerks? We're good 

people!",11
Phoebe," I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital 

watch.",12
Phoebe," Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her 

head?",10
Phoebe," 
Well I have this friend, Abby, who shaves her 

head. She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend 

cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.",29
Phoebe," Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you 

guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.",15
Phoebe," Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave 

us.",12
Phoebe," Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, 

you know, with sticks.",12
Joey," Good for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or 

rolls of quarters?",11
Joey," Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?",11
Joey," She said she wants to slather my body with stuff 

and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely 

want to be a part of it.",32
Joey," I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's 

on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.",13
Chandler," Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while 

he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?",22
Chandler," Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who 

left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?",21
Chandler," You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns 

around, it's a man) Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?",22
Chandler," That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to 

Janice) I've always wanted to know...",16
Monica," Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you 

to say hi to. (to Chandler) He just happened to call.",20
Ross," I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, 

then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, 

when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, 

he loses like a week and a half.",48
Ross," (nervously) You know 

they-they should be cooking the food soon.",10
Ross," The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman 

touching her is her... close, personal friend.",16
Ross," Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always 

forget that part. (to Carol and Susan) Helloo!",17
Phoebe," Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the 

sacramental wine.",12
Phoebe," Um, that's ok! (throws it in fire) Ok. All 

right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.",19
Rachel," Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we 

wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.",19
Phoebe," Ok, yeah, ok. (she throws the directions in) 

Oh, OK.",10
Rachel," (tossing things in the fire) Ok, Barry's 

letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.",12
Phoebe," Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner 

with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.",15
Phoebe," Mine! Oh Shoot!. 

(Tries to read the numbers) Ok remember this number, 9-7-4-3....(can't make out 

the rest of the numbers and gives up). Oh. Oh well. (goes back to waving her 

arms)",32
Chandler," Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as 

a toilet brush.",13
Ross," Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it 

be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, 

and pregnant, and, and sad. ",30
Ross," Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and 

join us?",11
Ross," Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll 

scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, 

this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, 

Kristin, Kristin...(struggling)...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't 

even her major!",43
Monica," You know, it's a really funny story how this 

happened. (laughs while talking) Well, you 

see I was taking out the trash and Phoebe was lighting incense...",27
Chandler," Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. 

(reading the candy) Chan and Jan Forever.",14
Chandler," Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, 

there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for 

me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.",35
Ross," You did so. I swear, I swear—(noticing Kristin's 

absence) How long has she been in the bathroom?",17
Ross," Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed 

up the first date I had in 9 years. ",19
Ross," Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You 

know, this is still pretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to 

his head. Carol picks it off)",33
Ross," No, it's just...you know the whole ""getting on 

with your life"" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this 

cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's 

it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, 

and, and I don't, I don't have to...",62
Ross," You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, 

what's say you and I give it another shot? ",16
Ross," No no no, I know what you're gonna say, 

you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? 

Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You 

can't deny it. Besides, I've got a ring at 

home that fits you. Uh..I've got,uh, lots of pictures with both of us in them. 

Okay? And-and, best of all...hey-hey you're carrying my 

baby. I mean, how perfect is that? ",80
Ross," But see, you know, you keep sayin' 

that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.",16
Ross," That's easy for you to say, you found one 

already.",10
Rachel," So you guys really 

just slide down the pole, huh?",10
Phoebe," (laughs) That's so 

cool. And how do you get back up?",11
Monica," Um, so, uh, woud you 

guys, uh..Well would you like to, uh...sometime maybe, uh, maybe you'd like 

to...",18
Rachel, And a nice hot cider for Monica. (Hands it to her.),11
Rachel," Oh! That's why. (Rachel checks behind her ear, and finds a 

cinnamon stick.) I'm sorry!",15
Chandler," Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, 

that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.",19
Chandler," Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had 

nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide 

a rubber chicken from the woman.) Nothing.  (Mrs. 

Tedlock leaves as Chandler stands on his chair to talk over the cubicle wall) 

And frankly I don’t think that those kinds of shenanigans have a place in this 

office environment. (starts do a little spinning dance in his chair)",73
Phoebe," Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this 

incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...",26
Phoebe, Never mind. But it was going to be really good.,10
Chandler," So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, 

and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing 

supervisor.",29
Chandler," If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this 

is what I actually do.",16
Joey," Oh 

man, does that mean we got to start buying our own toilet paper?",14
Ross," 

(pretending like he’s an announcer) That was Joey Tribbiani with the ‘Big 

Picture’, Dan?",14
Chandler," It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys 

that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.",26
Chandler," I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to 

do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.",26
Phoebe," Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage 

client... Steve? (pause) Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking 

for a head chef.",28
Phoebe," Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I 

know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the 

one who needs a job right now, so....",36
Chandler," Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. 

Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.",14
Phoebe," Well, he wants to do some eclectic, so he's looking for 

someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.",20
Phoebe," Yeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think?",11
Chandler," Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big 

white hat.",14
Ross," You 

watch something like this and you realize why evolution is just a theory.",14
Chandler," Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, 

career counselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the ""a-gogo.""",18
Chandler," Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.",10
Chandler," Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you 

want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.",27
Monica," So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. 

It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too 

small. Just right.",29
Chandler, Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?,11
Monica," So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, 

kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will 

be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.",42
Monica, I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!,13
Phoebe," Ooh! I know what you could make! (runs over to join Monica and 

Rachel in the kitchen) I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you 

know, with the stuff? (Monica doesn't know.) You know, that thing... with the 

stuff...? OK, I don't know. (sits down)",47
Ross," Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the 

neighborhood?",12
Joey," How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.",12
Ross," OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not 

dating a puma?",15
Rachel," (trying to sound like a bug) Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.",11
Ross," Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of 

insects at the museum.",16
Ross," Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe 

bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.",26
Joey," (aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, 

maybe... (gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?",17
Ross," Well, I don't know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I'm hoping 

(gestures) huh-huh.",11
Joey," I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to 

take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.",26
Ross," Celia, don't worry!  Don't scream!  He's not going to hurt you! 

Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...",17
Joey," I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just 

happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?",17
Chandler," Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence 

tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads 

them) ""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large 

multinational corporation.""",39
Phoebe, That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!,11
Chandler," Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who 

should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured 

myself doing something...something.",27
Rachel," (comes up and rubs him on the chest) Oh Chandler, I know, I 

know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!",24
Monica," (brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe 

this'll cheer you up.",15
Chandler," Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd 

better split this with you.",18
Monica," It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The 

French call it an amouz-bouche. ",15
Monica," (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Wendy! (Listens) Yeah, 

eight o'clock. (Listens) What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... (Listens) OK, 

great. (Listens) All right, I'll see you then. Bye. (hangs up)",33
Monica," Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me 

out.",14
Monica," But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, 

you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.",22
Rachel," Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status 

so that I can waitress in the Olympics.",20
Chandler," You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at 

Innsbruck in '76. Took home a bronze. (dead 

silence) Amouz-bouche? (holds out tray)",25
Ross," OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this 

morning...",13
Ross," All right, I panicked, all right? She took me by surprise. You 

know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.",25
Ross," Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the 

dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?",18
Joey," What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or 

what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to 

each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.",44
Joey," Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what 

you'd like to be doing right now.",20
Ross," That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not 

having this conversation. (gets up, walks across room)",19
Joey," (walks to catch up to him) All right, look, I'll start, OK?",12
Joey," Come on. Come on. All right, ready, look! (in a low voice) Oh... 

Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.",26
Joey," Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk 

dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!",25
Ross," OK, turn around. (Joey looks taken aback) I just don't want you 

staring at me when I'm doing this.",19
Joey," (turning around) All right, all right. I'm around. Go ahead.",10
Ross," Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin 

with my lips.",15
Ross," ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... 

with...",11
Chandler," It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to 

get together.",15
Joey," Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job 

called again.",14
Joey," And again, and again, and again... (phone rings, he answers) 

Hello? (hands phone to Chandler) And again.",17
Chandler," (on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth 

floor? (Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it's a lot less 

satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that's 

very generous (Listens) er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need 

something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... 

(Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? 

(Listens) Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a 

negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm 

telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll 

see you on Monday! (slams the phone down)",125
Phoebe," (excited) Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the 

cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.",16
Chandler," Look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of New York 

City)",14
Chandler, Yes indeedy! (they look outside) With a beautiful view of...,10
Chandler," (walks away from window) OK, that's enough of the view. 

Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.",20
Chandler," This is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) Helen, 

could you come in here for a moment? ",19
Monica," (shouting on phone) Wendy, we had a deal! (Listens) Yeah, you 

promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! (hangs up)",17
Rachel," Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye. (she walks away towards the 

door)",12
Rachel," Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.",12
Monica," You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was 

there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... 

(Rachel isn't buying it, desperate) twenty dollars an hour.",38
Rachel, Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?,10
Phoebe," (overemphasizing) Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You 

know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of (Monica 

signals her to stop) of, OK, smells.",28
Phoebe," (whispers) In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a 

doobie.",13
Phoebe," Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?",11
Rachel," OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK. Do 

you think it’s going to be cool or…?",16
Monica," Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. (Steve sits, 

Monica brings over a tray) OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and cilantro 

pondou sauce... (Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly)... with just a 

touch of mints... and... (he finishes)... ginger.",45
Monica," Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about 

eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.",24
Monica," (joining him and taking the taco shells) You know that? You 

don't want to spoil your appetite.",17
Monica," You know, if you just wait another... six and a half 

minutes...",12
Monica," Why don't you just have a seat here? (he sits at the table, 

then tries to secretly eat the Gummy-bears. Monica spots him.) OK... give me the 

Gummy-bears.",28
Monica," Why? What if I came into your office 

and I started I……..I can’t think of an example, ok? It's just that I've 

waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four 

and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?",45
Monica," So 

I told him ‘I’m sorry, that’s just how I feel’. And he told me I harshed his 

buzz. (makes a confused face) Then I said, ‘Don’t eat that, that’s a kitchen 

magnet’.  And then he didn’t listen, so we left him in the emergency room.",46
Rachel," You did the right thing. You 

don't want to work for a guy like that.",15
Monica," I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.",11
Phoebe, Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.,10
Rachel," Oh 

by the way, am I going to get paid for the full 3 hours? (Monica looks at her 

with an unhappy face.) It was just a question. I’ll ask later.",31
Joey," (to Ross) So, er... how did it go with Celia?",10
Ross," I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most 

elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot 

lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.",34
Ross," Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the 

dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...",27
Phoebe, You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?,11
Joey,"  (looks at his watch) Yeah, where the hell is he?",10
Chandler," (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm 

looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? 

Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about 

it! You got it? Good! (slams phone down, then leans back and realizes what just 

happened) Whooooaaaa....",57
Phoebe," See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt? (presses 

down elsewhere)",12
Phoebe," What about this? (she starts using her elbows on his back, he 

yells in pain)",15
Phoebe," There you go! (She continues to work him over with 

her elbows and he continues to yell in pain.)",19
Chandler," This is unbelievable. It’s been like a half an hour. If this 

was a cartoon, you’d be looking like a ham right about now.",24
Ross," I don’t know whether he’s testing me, or just acting out, but my 

monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, 

""supposedly"" by accident.",30
Ross," And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper 

before I did, and peed all over the crossword.",22
Chandler," All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn’t look 

exactly like her sister.",16
Chandler," You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about 

things?",14
Chandler," Oh, you do? Because she said you guys haven’t talked in like 

years.",13
Phoebe," It’s mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, 

everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was 

the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. 

But, to my parents, by then it was like ""yeah, right, well what else is new?""",57
Ross," Oh, Pheebs, I’m sorry, I’ve got to go. I’ve got Lamaze class.",12
Chandler," Oh, and I’ve got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.",12
Ross," No, Susan’s gonna be there too. We’ve got dads, we’ve got 

lesbians, the whole parenting team.",16
Ross," No, no. (Distractedly putting on a jacket to go out) I mean, it 

mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I’m pretty comfortable with the 

whole situation.",30
Ross," Hi, um, I’m err, (has to clear his throat) I’m Ross Geller, and 

err ah... (pats Carol’s bulge) ..that’s, that’s my boy in there, and uh, 

(points) this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carol’s, 

just, com... (embarrassment finally overwhelms the poor fellow, who becomes 

incoherent until) ..who’s next?",54
Ross," Absolutely. (Turns back to the woman next to him.) So, twins... 

hah! That’s like two births. (He struggles again.) Ouch.",20
Chandler," Uh, Yes. Yes. I’ve just been going over your data here, and 

little thing, you’ve been post-dating your Friday numbers.",20
Monica," 
K, I'll take ""Idiots in the Workplace"" for $200 Alex.",10
Chandler," It’s not just that she’s cute, okay. It’s just that... she’s 

really really cute.",14
Ross, It doesn’t matter. You don’t dip your pen in the company ink.,12
Ross," Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give 

Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...",21
Rachel," (Looking at the television) Cool... ""Urkel"" in Spanish is ""Urkel.""",10
Chandler," (Looking out at the balcony) So tell me something, is 

leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year 

long?",26
Monica," Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down 

around New Year’s... but obviously someone forgot.",18
Rachel," Well, someone was supposed to write ""Rach, take down 

the lights"" and put it on the re... frigerate... (finally noticing Monica’s note 

stuck to the refrigerator) How long has that been there?",32
Joey," I went back to Riff’s. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered 

was coffee, she brought me a tuna melt and four plates of curly fries.",27
Chandler," Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you 

might wanna run it by err... (he indicates Phoebe, who is helping Ross 

understand the remote control.)",26
Joey, You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?,12
Joey," So that if we went out on a date, she’d be there.",12
Phoebe," Well, I mean, I’m not my sister’s, you know, whatever, and 

um... I mean, it’s true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we’ve grown 

apart, so, um... I don’t know, why not? Okay.",36
Ross," No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both 

know what’s going on.",17
Ross," Okay, I’m gonna play my sperm card one more time.",10
Ross," Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!",10
Chandler," Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept 

funny, and my hair was very very snarly.",21
Chandler," 
No that's not a problem sir. That's why my name's on 

the door. By the way, do you know when I'm getting my name on the door?",27
Chandler," Nina? Nina. (He goes around his desk to where she is 

sitting.) Nina. (In pain) Nina.",16
Chandler," (Looking down at her hand) Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the 

reason that I called you in here today was, err... please don’t hate me.",26
Phoebe," Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy 

it with me.",17
Rachel," Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and 

Evelyn?",12
Monica," I can’t believe you. You still haven’t told that girl she 

doesn’t have a job yet?",16
Chandler," I’m just trying to find the right moment, you know?",10
Rachel," Oh, well, that shouldn’t be so hard, now that you’re dating. 

(Imitating men at their worst) ""Sweetheart, you’re fired, but how ’bout a 

quickie before I go to work?""",29
Chandler," You know, once you’re inside, you don’t have to knock any 

more.",12
Monica," We’re not doing anything. We’re just sitting around talking, 

quietly.",10
Joey," Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just 

wanna make sure it fits.",19
Phoebe," Ooh, my first birthday present... (delightedly examining the 

cardigan in her lap) ..oh, this is really...",16
Joey," Oh, no no no. It’s for Ursula. I just figured, you know, 

size-wise.",13
Phoebe," Ohhh... Sure, yeah... (disgustedly dropping the cardigan back 

into the bag) ..okay, it fits.",14
Chandler," Wow, this is serious. I’ve never known you to pay money for 

any kind of capade.",16
Joey," I don’t know. I like her, you know. She’s different. There’s uh, 

somethin’ about her.",15
Phoebe," That you like, (snappily confronting Joey over the heads of 

the knitting circle) we get it. You like her. Great!",20
Joey," Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.",11
Joey, Okay... Well maybe now I’m not okay with it not being okay.,12
Chandler," Yes, yes she is. Didn’t I memo you on this? See, after I let 

her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. 

Flan. ",30
Chandler," And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather 

badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.",21
Chandler," Oh, no, no. Nina... (miming fairies twinkling around his 

head) ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, 

she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.",37
Chandler," And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again 

until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.",26
Chandler," Well, I guess that’s why they call it psychology, sir.",10
Ross," I always knew I was havin’ a baby, I just never realised the 

baby was having me.",17
Ross," Aw, how can you say that? I can’t even get Marcel to stop eating 

the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?",24
Chandler," You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that 

monkeys and babies are actually different. (slowly) 

You might want to look into it.",24
Phoebe," Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?",11
Joey," Well, not that it’s any of your business, but, no, we haven’t, 

okay?",13
Chandler," Oh, well, ah... maybe that’s because they’re ah... jealous, 

of us.",11
Chandler," Ah, well, maybe that’s, ah, because you’re getting a big 

raise.",11
Chandler," Oh, you don’t know. (Presses a button.) Helen, could you 

make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder’s raise?",21
Ross," 

Right, because you were really in control up until then. ",10
Phoebe," Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make 

them go away? Because I can’t, I can’t watch.",22
Phoebe," Yeah. It’s just, you know, it’s this whole stupid Ursula 

thing, it’s...",12
Rachel," Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he’s going out with her. I mean, 

is it really so terrible?",18
Phoebe," Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I’m not saying she’s like evil 

or anything. She just, you know, she’s always breaking my stuff. When I 

was eight, and I wouldn’t let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it 

under the bus. And then when I was 12 and she broke my 

collar bone. All right, she didn't mean to do it but I think it still counts. 

(Chandler nods his head.) And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, 

who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?",97
Phoebe," Well, but that’s what he was for me. And she you know, kind of 

stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldn’t even talk 

to me any more. Because he said he didn’t wanna be around... anything 

that looked like either one of us.",48
Phoebe," I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or 

anything, but...",15
Ross," No, come on, he doesn’t know this stuff. If he knew how you 

felt.",14
Rachel," Oh please, they’ve been going out a week. They haven’t even 

slept together yet, I mean, that’s not serious.",19
Monica," Rachel, what are you doing? It’s freezing out here. Would you 

come back inside?",14
Rachel," No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... (she 

climbs onto the railing to reach the top of a pole) ..I’m takin’ ’em down. Okay? 

Whoa! (Screams.)",32
Monica, Oh-my-god Rachel! (Rushing out to look over the edge) Rachel!,10
Rachel," (To Monica) I’m okay! I’m okay! (She knocks on Mr. Heckles's 

window.) Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?",21
Rachel, Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.,14
Monica," Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, 

and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or 

something.",29
Monica," Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... 

Okay, are you currently on any medication? ",12
Monica," Oh, that is so sweet. (Touched, she puts an arm around her 

friend and kisses her.) Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?",21
Rachel," Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.",10
Monica," I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred 

dollars.",13
Rachel," (Like a big baby) Um... unless, unless I use yours.",10
Monica," Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.",11
Rachel," (Tapping the clipboard) well, now, wait a second, who did I 

just put as my ""In case of emergency"" person?",20
Monica," (Looking around to check that no-one's listening, then 

lowering her voice anyway) That's insurance fraud.",15
Rachel," Well, alright, then, forget it. (Getting up to go) Might as 

well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!",19
Monica," (Jumping up to make Rachel sit down) Okay, okay. I hate this.",12
Monica," (to the nurse) Hi, (tiny laugh) um, I'm gonna need a new set 

of (tiny laugh) these forms (tiny laugh).",20
Monica," (Tiny laugh) I am really an idiot. (Tiny laugh) you see, I was 

filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, (tiny 

laugh) I put mine.",29
Monica," (Tiny laugh) yep, that's me, (tiny laugh) I am that 

stupid (tiny laugh).",13
Ross," I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my 

kid.",14
Ross," No, no, with him. (He mimes holding the baby like a 

football.) I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I 

know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at 

me.",41
Ross," Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can 

take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.",27
Ross," Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm 

the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm 

gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I 

woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.",56
Chandler," Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, 

most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.",23
Joey," Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.",10
Joey," Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? 

Is it real expensive?",17
Joey," What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up 

with Ursula.",17
Joey," Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, 

wouldn't you guys?",13
Chandler," Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, 

you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.",21
Monica," Yes? (jumping as Rachel punches her arm) ..yes, she is.",10
Rachel," I meant er, (struggling to concentrate) young, young, I meant 

young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.",19
Rachel," ..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.",12
Rachel," Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for 

tomorrow night, and I said ""yes.""",18
Monica," I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the 

hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow 

off the dates.",30
Rachel," What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, (spelling it 

out in the air for her slow friend) cute doctors, doctors who are cute!",24
Ross, What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.,12
Monica," Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.",15
Ross," (Still annoyed) Yeah, we'll just use our special cake 

tools.",10
Phoebe," (Delighted) oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was 

not at all scary. (Looks at the smushed cake). Oh 

look-- Happy Birthday Peehe. What a strange new nickname? I like it. Oh my god!Hi 

everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! (Thrilled) You found Betty! Oh my god! (Hugging 

people) This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, (still happy) 

Where's Joey?",67
Ross," Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?",11
Ross," Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did 

you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, ""Oh my god I'm gonna be a father"" kind 

of a thing?",32
Ross," Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to 

know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?",24
Rachel," Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we 

really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.",25
Monica," A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?",11
Monica," I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be 

such a, a big baby.",19
Rachel," (Resenting the truth) I am not a baby! You know what? I 

swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...",24
Rachel," Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.",11
Rachel," (as Monica) Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel 

moved in a few months ago.",17
Monica," (as Rachel) Yeah... (joining the others) ..see, I was supposed 

to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.",22
Monica," (as Rachel) Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, 

hey, that's me. (Indicating a dish on the table) Why don't you try the hummus?",26
Rachel," (as Monica) Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.",10
Rachel," (as Monica) Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss 

people around, which I just love to do.",19
Monica," 

(as Rachel) (Suddenly laughing) Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!",12
Monica," 
(as Rachel) That was years ago, and you had no idea 

that the lipstick was in your pocket. Did I tell you that I think I am so much 

cuter than I am?",33
Rachel," (as Monica) And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high 

school, I was a cow?",18
Rachel, (as Monica) I use my breasts to get other people's attention.,11
Monica," (as Rachel) (Revealing her anger to point at her best friend)

We both do that!",15
Monica," (as Rachel) Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. (Getting up to move 

further away from Rachel) li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but 

there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...",37
Monica," (as Rachel) Remember back in freshman year? (Talking fast 

before Rachel can catch her) Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.",24
Rachel," (on phone) Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep 

with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! (Rachel turns 

to Monica, clasping the receiver to her bosom so Dr.Green can't hear, while 

mouthing ""You are..."") ...dead!",41
Monica," 
(yelling out loud so Rachel's dad can hear her over 

the phone) Hey Rachel, are these your condoms?",18
Chandler," 
Well okay, then I am using that same argument for ""fligament.""

",11
Rachel," Ok Daddy, Daddy, that is the other 

line. Ok no, not even my bedroom. (sadly) Ok ok, bye-bye. (checks to see who it 

is on the other line.) Hello? (Listens) Um, yeah, uh, (snapping her 

fingers at Ross who takes the remote from Marcel, then turns off the TV) Okay 

ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.",66
Rachel," It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says 

there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...",20
Monica," I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? 

Find out what they want!",17
Rachel," Okay (desperately hands the receiver over) no, you do it.",10
Monica," (taking the phone) Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... 

(Smiles at Rachel to reassure her) Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right 

down.(Listens) Thank you. (Hangs up)",28
Rachel," Ohhh... (slumping in relief) Okay, you were right. You were 

right! This was just not worth it.",17
Phoebe," Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there 

for you?",12
Ross," 
(to Monica, referring to the Scrabble game) What is 

that?",10
Joey," I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, 

they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.",26
Phoebe," I can't believe you... (holding up Joey's cardigan) ..did 

this.",10
Monica," (as Rachel) Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about 

needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a 

whole new one (little laugh) because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name 

again. (Little laugh) 'cause um...",46
Rachel," (as Monica) Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a



check.",14
Rachel," (as Monica) Yeah, I know... (mirroring her friend) ..I'm I'm 

just not that bright either.",15
Rachel," 
Mon, I'm sorry about last night, what I said. I don't 

think you're anything like you're mother.",17
Monica," 
Oh that's all right. I don't think you were selfish 

for running out on Barry. ",15
Rachel," 

Ooh ooh, I'm sorry that I said that you were a cow in high school. ",15
Chandler," Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a 

father.",11
Chandler," Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all 

of his relationships are affected by this.",19
Ross, You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!,10
Ross," No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across 

town he's choking I don't know what else to do.",21
Ross," Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches 

Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have 

a heart!",24
Joey," ..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.",11
Joey," No, no, no, don't say ""listen."" I know that ""listen."" I've said 

that ""listen.""",14
Joey," I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said 

under the bridge?",14
Phoebe," (as Ursula) That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on 

you!",14
Joey," Oh, Urse... (He tries to take her in his arms, but she fends him 

off.)",15
Phoebe," (as Ursula) If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?",12
Phoebe," (as Ursula) Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, 

it's either her or me.",17
Phoebe," (as Ursula) You know... (unconsciously putting a hand on his 

knee) You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.",20
Joey," I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... 

what, but you have never looked so beautiful.",19
Ross," Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 

'O'.",15
Ross," Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping 

now.",12
Chandler," (Tapping Ross on his shoulder) So, you feel like a dad yet?",12
Chandler," Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. 

That is very dad.",17
Monica," ¿A quién pidio el pollo General Tso? (Who ordered General 

Sal's chicken?)",12
Chandler, ¡Pudo aver sido General Tso! (It could've been General Sal!),10
Rachel," ¡Mira, mira, el viejo desnudo está haciendo el hula hoop! 

(Look, look, Ugly Naked Guy is doing the hula!)",19
Monica," Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto. (Look, Ross, 

Marcel's got the remote.)",14
Ross," ¡Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele! (The thing is, he 

doesn`t like the program!)",18
Chandler," Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones 

to work for.",14
Rachel," Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot 

be a waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being 

called 'Excuse me...'",32
Rachel," 

Ok you guys, we are almost done. We've only got 20 more to go.",14
Ross," Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent

compuper skills.",12
Rachel," (upset) Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?",13
Joey," Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few.",10
Chandler," 
You know, I know they call this a Love Seat, but I'm 

not really feeling anything special towards you.",19
Chandler," You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't 

you go out with her again?",18
Chandler," Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've 

really happened' thing?",12
Ross," No, it's not just that. It's just—I want someone who... who 

does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes 

me, uh... (begins to stare lovingly at Rachel)",32
Joey," There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, 

alright?",12
Ross," Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'",10
Rachel," Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?",12
Phoebe," Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some 

kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?",25
Phoebe," Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, 

like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?",23
Chandler, There just don't happen to be any women in our games.,11
Joey," Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to 

play poker.",15
Ross," Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?",10
Monica," So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.",11
Phoebe," OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of 

clubs.",15
Rachel," Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! (gives it to Phoebe)",13
Ross," No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.",10
Rachel," Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going 

for fours.",12
Ross," Oh, you're... (gives up) Oh Chandler, 

could you? (points to a newspaper) Thanks man!",14
Monica," Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted 

crudites.",11
Joey," Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker 

game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like 

chips, or dip, or pretz...(look of realization)",32
Monica," 
Well I'll hope you'll let it slide just this once, see 

I was all out of Pretz. ",17
Monica," Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. 

High stakes... big bucks...",17
Ross," Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because 

they didn't look happy...",15
Chandler," OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds 

up two cards) Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. (Joey is unamused) Alright 

babe, deal the cards.",25
Phoebe," A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... 

lying?",12
Rachel," OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax 

before work tomorrow... (gets up to leave)",20
Chandler," The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is 

giving us the land, so...",15
Ross," The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.",12
Joey," You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we 

just forget about the money, alright?",18
Rachel," So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money 

from all of your friends.",14
Chandler," Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put 

them together yourself, but they cost a little less.",21
Ross," Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order 

for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, 

don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... 

(claps hands three times)",48
Chandler," Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?",11
Joey," No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.",13
Ross," Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time—not 

any more. I just—I...",16
Ross," You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK—if you press that 

button, you are in very, very big trouble.",20
Rachel, (opening mail) Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?,11
Monica," That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the 

plate slipped out of my hand.",16
Phoebe," Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.",10
Rachel, Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!,10
Monica," OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker 

since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. (opens door) Hi!",27
Rachel," 

Don't you mean he thinks he's a woman trapped in a man's body? ",13
Phoebe," Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?",10
Chandler," Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all 

recommending Trident?",13
Rachel," Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. 

We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, 

and—oh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do 

this. I can do this well!",49
Rachel," Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...",10
Monica," OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.",11
Joey," Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you 

don't want to play, we completely understand.",19
Chandler," Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I 

don't know... Pictionary?",15
Monica," Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give 

poker another try. Shall we, ladies?",19
Rachel," No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.",13
Rachel," Alright... (shuffles cards expertly, all the guys stare in 

amazement)",10
Ross," So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe 

fifteen big ones.",15
Joey," But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we 

gotta play that at our regular game.",18
Phoebe," Alright, here's my $7.50. (Hands them the money) But I think 

you should know that this money is cursed.",19
Phoebe," Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who 

spends it.",15
Chandler," That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me 

anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.",21
Ross," Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes 

fifteen...",12
Ross," 
Huh..let's see..um..say Rach I am opening up a new art 

gallery and I could sure use portraits of Lincoln and Hamilton. (in reference to 

their portraits on the bills)",29
Rachel," Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I 

have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women. (hands over 

her money)",29
Monica," You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and 

we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will 

take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.",43
Ross," So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't 

have to go through the formality of actually playing.",22
Rachel," Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, 

monkey boy.",13
Monica," OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some 

serious poker?",14
Phoebe," (holding a card and waving it in front of her face) Hey you 

guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. (they look at her) 

Right, OK, serious poker.",31
Joey," 
Hey Mon, do you have any more of those salmon things?",11
Monica," 
Do you wanna eat or do you wanna play poker?",10
Monica," Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?",14
Rachel," Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and 

the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.",21
Joey, That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.,11
Phoebe, (looks at her cards) Yes! (everyone looks at her) .... or no.,12
Rachel," Your fly is open, Geller. (he checks it, and zips up)",11
Phoebe," You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' 

with a 'J.' Coincidence?",15
Ross," Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. 

(lays down cards)",14
Joey," Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a 

fat guy with sores on his face. (the girls look at him, confused) Oh, I'm out.",31
Rachel," Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. (throws chips in 

pot) What do you say... want to waste another buck?",22
Ross," No, not this time. (he folds) So... what'd you have?",10
Ross," Come on, show them to me. (reaches for her cards, Rachel covers 

them up)",14
Rachel," (deals new hand) Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? 

Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...",25
Rachel," (on phone) Excuse me. (covers up phone; to Ross) It's about 

the job.",13
Rachel," Barbara! Hi, how are you? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) No, I 

understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but 

you know, if-if anything else opens up, plea—Hello? Hello? (hangs up phone, very 

depressed)",39
Rachel," Yeah...(sigh)....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, 

uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.",17
Rachel," I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. 

(throws it in)",14
Rachel," Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five 

bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?",22
Rachel," What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I 

thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were 

you just full of it?",34
Rachel," Dealer takes two. (she deals herself two cards) What do you 

bet?",12
Rachel, OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. (throws it in),12
Ross," I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. (throws it in)",10
Joey," Here, I got five, I got five. (Ross takes the money)",11
Ross," Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the 

cards, you know. (looks at Rachel) But, uh... look how happy she is. (smiles)",26
Rachel," Thank you. (Examines it) Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!",10
Rachel," Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement 

notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!",22
Monica," (Takes it) That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. (Sees Rachel's 

look) Lucky….to have had a friend like you. (Gets up) 

You know what? (In a low voice) It’s quiet time. Shh! Shh! Shh! (She leaves)",35
Ross," Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good 

boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. (Marcel brings the rice) Thank you, good 

boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 

'pee in the'. (Rachel ignores him) 'Bring me the' and- Rach?",51
Rachel," Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, 

right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.",27
Rachel," No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with 

somebody.",14
Ross," Whoa, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done 

with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?",17
Rachel," Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about 

the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but 

there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just 

this raw, animal, sexual...",49
Rachel," Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? You know? 

Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your 

toes curl?",29
Ross," Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very 

often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be 

the one who...",28
Phoebe," I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, 

guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...",20
Joey," Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as 

there's a little nudity.",17
Joey," I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to 

see Lou Grant frolicking.",13
Ross," All right, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go 

take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.",22
Ross," That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, 

aren't you.",11
Monica," Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?",13
Ross," 'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even 

gonna be there.",12
Chandler," I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with 

Rachel, they would've happened already?",16
Ross," I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with 

someone exactly like me.",15
Ross," Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's 

looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.",22
Ross," Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two 

of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...",23
Chandler," I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of 

my monkey.",16
Ross," Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go 

over there and, uh, try to woo her.",22
Chandler," Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to 

the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.",20
Rachel," Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, 

she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're 

glad she's dying. Okay- (Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) Wh- wh- 

Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- 

whoa. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? (Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, 

bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices the newsletter and taps the contents of the 

shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm 

sure you didn't register for that. (She leaves the apartment holding the 

newsletter at arm's length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs out 

in the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) 

Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we 

know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- (Looks down and notices he is 

missing) Marcel? Marc- (Notices the open door)",175
Rachel," I don't know. I don’t know. We were watching TV, and then he 

pooped in Monica's shoe-",17
Rachel," Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with 

everything.",12
Phoebe," Whoa, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?",10
Monica, Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.,10
Phoebe," No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the 

left one is lucky...",13
Rachel," C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?",11
Joey," All right all right. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. 

Where do you go?",16
Chandler," Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna 

do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the 

Russian Tea Room.",28
Rachel," Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! 

He's gonna kill me!",16
Monica," Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first 

and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.",21
Rachel," Well, what am I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?",10
Monica," Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray 

Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.",22
Monica," Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?",11
Phoebe, Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?,10
Rachel," (On the phone) Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchin monkey with 

a white face... (Enter Ross) ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on 

the side. Okay. Thanks.",29
Rachel," Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?",10
Rachel," Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not 

drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?",24
Ross," Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the 

murder capital of the Northeast, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by 

you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and 

stuff? (Uncorks the wine) Well-",46
Rachel," Oh God... Okay. All right. All right. Okay. Ross, please don't 

hate me.",13
Ross," (Angry) I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked 

you to do was keep him in the apartment.",23
Ross," No, you know what, I guess it's partially my fault. You know, I 

shouldn't have, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started 

you off with like a pen or a pencil.",36
Rachel," (Tearfully) Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got 

everybody looking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh! 

Who is it?",29
Ross," Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not 

allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from 

me.",25
Rachel," O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...",10
Ross," That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite 

them to the apartment!",15
Rachel," Oh, you know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! (Ross 

puts his arms around her and they act all sweetness and light)",22
Ross," Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.",10
Monica," Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen 

Marcel.",11
Phoebe, Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?,11
Monica," Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly 

to yourself first?",13
Monica," Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! 

Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.",24
Monica," Be that as it may, do you think you could just help us out 

here on that monkey thing? You know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?",28
Chandler," Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking 

for something...",13
Joey," Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the 

other way?",15
Chandler," Oh, no no no wait wait wait no no! Uh... we may not know 

anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in 

the heating and cooling... milieu.",34
Joey," Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?",11
Chandler," Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! 

And they're very hot.",16
Joey," We can't, all right? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no 

idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's 

about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures 

of you, you'd really be helping us out.",51
Chandler," Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.",12
Monica," Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! (Marcel runs off and Luisa runs 

after him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay?",23
Phoebe," Yeah, think so. Oh! (She notices the tranquilizer dart has hit 

her in the butt and removes it) Huh. (Sways back) Whoa.",22
Ross," Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the 

neighborhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.",16
Ross," Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. 

(Kicks a sign in frustration) And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, 

and a broken foot! Thank you very much.",36
Rachel," Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want 

me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right 

here. (Kicks the sign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you 

happy now?!",48
Ross," Yeah, yeah. You know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't 

miss Marcel any more!",17
Rachel," You know, it is not like I did this on purpose.",11
Ross," Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things 

just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your 

Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...",37
Phoebe," Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, 

and the other side has no idea.",20
Ross," Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?",11
Ross," Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon. (Marcel starts to go to 

him)",12
Ross," (To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't 

have been fat.",16
Rachel," All right. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the 

homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there!

But this isn’t high school anymore, this is real life. 

Okay, and we are all adults here.


",42
Joey," 

(standing behind the standing magnifying glass) Heckles! Can I have this?",11
Rachel," For the most part. But if you 

take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You 

can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a 

chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!",49
Rachel," All right. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I 

tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?",25
Ross," It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. 

(Marcel resists) Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.",25
Rachel," You know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great 

little outfit.",15
Ross," Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before; it's just 

I...",14
Rachel," Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...",10
Ross," Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, you know? You, you 

were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in 

the mood for, uh, something grape?",36
Ross," All right. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and 

turns off the main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The, uh, the 

neighbors must be vacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well, so 

long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how 

mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially 

because of how we, um...",79
Monica," Ok ok fine. All right. (They all 

gather around her to view her high school yearbook.) This is me in 

The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?",29
Joey," I don’t know, I loved high school. You know? It was just four 

years of parties and dating and sex.",20
Chandler," Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. 

Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.",21
Phoebe," Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! (She stands up and starts to dance around) 

Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!",21
Chandler," I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much 

rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.",18
Joey," No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, 

the toughest snack there is.",18
Ross," I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're 

craaazy.",12
Monica," (looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta 

come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!",23
Phoebe," How can people do that?... (All but Phoebe walk away from the 

window in disgust.) Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!",25
Chandler," I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study 

it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. ",21
Chandler,"  I’ll say yay! It was 

unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves; we didn't have to play any games...",18
Chandler," Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls 

make disgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the 

guys) I'm right, right?",32
Monica," I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find 

one of you people.",15
Phoebe," Oh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop 

being so testosteroney!",14
Chandler," Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls 

her, then hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.",20
Chandler," Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I 

ended up using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o.""",17
Monica," Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at 

once!",12
Ross," Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just 

told to shove anything?",17
Phoebe," No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do 

that!!",12
Phoebe," That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel 

enters.) Oh!",12
Chandler," (bluffing) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.",10
Rachel," You know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took 

me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where you 

know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...",37
Rachel," Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him 

not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...",23
Ross," That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to 

stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?",25
Rachel," Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was 

just so nice to see him again, you know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... 

it was just nice!",30
Monica," Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who 

you left at the altar?",17
Rachel," Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, 

like, Orthodontist Guy, you know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong 

with that?",27
Monica," Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, 

who just happens to be your ex-best friend?",19
Rachel," All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know 

it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!",30
Rachel," I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.",11
Rachel," Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...",10
Chandler," 

Ok fine all right. (on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I 

wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles 

some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs up.) Oh God!",34
Monica," That's what you've been working on for the 

past two hours?!",11
Chandler," Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. 

you know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around 

here honing for the past few hours.",35
Monica," (looking out the window) Look look! He's doing it again, the 

guy with the telescope!",15
Phoebe," Oh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop 

looking in here!",14
Joey," Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I 

caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do 

stuff!",28
Joey," Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, 

when I'm cooking naked.",16
Chandler, What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.,11
Rachel," No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?",10
Rachel," No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not 

for me. ",14
Monica," Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand 

can also be used as a phone.",18
Phoebe," You know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she 

has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.",27
Monica," You see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked 

about.",13
Chandler," I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and 

is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being 

needy.",29
Monica," (wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental 

floss in your hair?",15
Rachel, (in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair.,12
Monica," You had sex in his chair?!... 

I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?",15
Rachel," I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's 

a history there. It’s like you and Carol.",20
Ross," No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!",10
Rachel," Please. If she said to you, ""Ross, I want you on this couch, 

right here, right now,"" what would you say? ",21
Ross," It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally different situation! It's, it's 

apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.",21
Ross," (leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? 

I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam-packed schedule, and I am 

late- for keeping up with it. Okay?",39
Rachel," (on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? 

(Listens) Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations,  that is so great. (Listens) 

Really? (Listens) Oh. (Listens) Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if 

you want you can, you can, you can come by and... (Listens) Okay... (Listens) 

Great... (Listens) Great... (Listens) All right, so I'll, so I'll see you 

tomorrow! (Listens) Okay.. (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up and sits 

down heavily.) Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.",77
Rachel," Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really 

weird, I gotta call Barry... (Does so. Everybody lifts up their feet for 

preparation) (on phone) Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured 

that's where you'd be!",41
Rachel," Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out 

by Mindy.",15
Rachel," Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she 

calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! 

We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..",40
Rachel," And now, you know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I 

feel so..",14
Joey," Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught 

you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, 

or- (Rachel exits and slams the door in his face.) That's fine, yeah...",41
Chandler," Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?",12
Chandler," Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me 

pee?",14
Chandler," I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.",12
Chandler," No! (Calls as he sits on the head of Monica’s chair with his 

feet on the seat; Monica puts a towel under his feet) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, 

it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call 

me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) 

Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. (Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) 

(to Monica) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. (He starts doing 

a little jig.) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the 

other line, gonna call me back...",107
Rachel," (draws back) Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, 

when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.",25
Rachel," Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.",13
Rachel, (offers her arm to Mindy and she sniffs) Smell familiar?,10
Joey," I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no 

answer.",14
Chandler," (investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it 

off!",12
Monica," Just like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) ... 

Just pointing out the irony.",17
Joey," Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the 

doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",23
Joey," (to Monica) Can I use your phone? (On phone) Yeah, the number 

for a Sidney Marks, please.",17
Joey," (on phone) Yeah, is Sidney there? (Listens) Oh, this is? (To the 

gang) Sidney's a woman.",16
Joey," Yeah. Yeah, so what? (On phone) Look, I live across the street, 

(walking to the window) and I know all about you and your little telescope, and 

I don't appreciate it, okay? (Listens) Yeah, I can see you right now! (Listens) 

Hello! (Listens) If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I 

shouldn't have to feel like—(Listens)—Thank you, but... that's not really the 

point... (Listens) The point is that... (Listens) Mostly free weights, but 

occasionally..",77
Joey," (on phone) Yeah, my neighbor... (Listens) Yeah, the brunette... 

(to Monica) She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.",24
Joey," Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.",10
Joey," 

(listens) She wants to know why you tie the towel around your head.",13
Chandler," 

It’s a leave-in conditioner, ok! (Joey gives him the phone.) It’s a leave-in 

conditioner.",14
Rachel," Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?",11
Rachel," Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her 

out of a lineup!",14
Rachel," Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.",11
Rachel," 

 What is with you and Aruba? I mean, do you have like a deal with airlines?


",16
Rachel," Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was 

sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too 

much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling 

you, this feels great.",47
Rachel," What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's 

Satan in a smock!",16
Rachel, And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.,12
Rachel," Yeah! You know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, 

I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.",26
Joey," All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I 

mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...",23
Chandler," That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...",11
Chandler," Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole 

thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I 

mean,... how needy is that?",32
Monica," 

 Mother, all I am saying is just once can we go to lunch and not talk about what 

I’m wearing, or how I’m doing my hair, or where my career is going? (Mrs. Geller 

is about to say something but Monica abruptly interrupts)….or who I’m dating?",46
Monica," 

(gives the waiter her credit card). Here take it. Go. Run! (he takes off)",14
Monica," 

(interrupts) Career! You don’t have to worry about me. Okay? I’m doing fine.


",13
Joey, How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?,11
Monica, I have no idea. But look how much they spent!,10
Rachel," Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that 

you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.",22
Ross," I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of 

already thrown caution to the wind.",17
Chandler," Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.",11
Chandler," 

You see when I say geek, I mean….oh the hell with it. You bought a $70 mop; 

you’re a geek.


",20
Phoebe," Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! (Points to a lamp 

which is shaking behind the sofa)",18
Ross," Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come 

back- (Marcel runs toward Rachel's room) come here, Marcel-",19
Ross," You 

think you guys would be just a little more understanding. You know?",13
Ross, Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.,10
Rachel, Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.,11
Rachel," Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.",10
Monica," She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look 

at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys 

clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three 

hundred dollars on art supplies.",45
Monica," Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could 

do all this stuff. Only I don't.",21
Monica," Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the 

New School?",16
Monica," This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she 

doesn't have my mother.",15
Joey," No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name 

that's more neutral.",15
Joey," Plus, you know, I think it should be Joe. You know, Joey makes 

me sound like I'm, I don’t know, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which 

I'm not.",30
Chandler," Well, it does not ring a bell with me.

But a-you’re more plugged into that whole showbiz 

thing.


",18
Joey," (Writes it down) Joe Stalin. You know, that's pretty good.",10
Chandler," Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph 

Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.",16
Monica," Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I 

believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.

 I had a recent head injury and certain numbers and 

dates…….(shouts for no reason) Barbeque! (Listens) Oh did I? See, there you go.",50
Monica," (Hushes her) All right, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I'm 

going to tap class.",15
Rachel," What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole 

your credit card?",15
Monica," This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.",13
Rachel, Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ,10
Monica," 

This women has got my life, and I should see who she is.",13
Rachel,"
 Okay, Monica, you know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I 

mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.",22
Phoebe," This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the 

love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.",19
Phoebe," I think she means (Imitates) 'You dance
a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon. (They put on some spare shoes)",19
Monica," Okay, do you see anybody you think could be me?",10
Phoebe," (Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I'm totally getting 

it!",12
Monica," Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably 

uncoordinated?",12
Phoebe," Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with 

Rachel.",12
Monica, Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.,12
Chandler," She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic 

cones, is she?",14
Ross," She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's 

reached sexual maturity.",13
Ross," She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting aggressive 

and violent.",13
Chandler," I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an 

adult already?",17
Ross," I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and 

before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.",27
Ross," No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular 

access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta 

get him into a zoo.",32
Chandler," I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.",10
Ross," Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first 

choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, you know, like, uh, San Diego... 

right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, you know, he's out of 

state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.",54
Chandler," Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I 

mean, it's a total party zoo.",17
Ross," What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. 

She's a stealer.",14
Monica," You know what? After you're with this woman for like ten 

minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, 

with this amazing spirit.",29
Monica," It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room 

six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth 

floor!",29
Monica, ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!,12
Rachel," Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the 

dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. (Exits)",28
Monica," Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm 

not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.",23
Monica," Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.",11
Ross," (Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn't get into 

Scranton. (To the others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and 

cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.",38
Ross," Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want 

him?",12
Joey," Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all 

these people. You'd think you would've known that!",17
Chandler," You know, you'd think I would've. 

Hey how about Joey Heatherton?


",11
Joey," Come on. Seriously. I told you I don’t 

want to go back to Joey. Phoebe. What do you think a good stage name for 

me would be?",27
Ross," He can hold a banana, if that's what you mean...",10
Joey," We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...",13
Ross," He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!",12
Monica," Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.

I think I kissed an Arch Bishop. Or of course, it 

could have been a chef.",24
Monica, Noooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I'm lying. I am so drunk.,11
Rachel," Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, you know what, you could've called, 

I have been up here, I've been worried...",19
Rachel," Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they 

wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?",20
Rachel," Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! 

This is not you!",15
Monica," No, it is me! You know, I'm not just the person who needs to 

fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! You know, when I'm 

with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!",43
Rachel," Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for 

you, the credit card people.",17
Monica," Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were 

using.",12
Monica," I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.",12
Monica," No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't 

for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the

Wintergarden Theater!",31
Monica," I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna 

do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take 

me to the Big Apple Circus?",33
Phoebe," Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. All right, I wrote you this 

poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.",23
Chandler," Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of 

babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.",24
Joey," I don’t know what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.",11
Rachel," (Brings Marcel a teddy bear) Marcel, this is for you. It's, 

uh, just, you know, something to, um, do on the plane.",22
Ross," Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me 

and him.",16
Ross," Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and 

sits beside him) Well buddy, this is it. There's just a couple of things I want 

to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've 

been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down 

and starts humping his leg) Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? 

Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take 

him away. Just take him.",92
Joey," Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.",10
Chandler," (sarcastically) Oh, come on tell me. I could use another 

reason why women won't look at me.",17
Rachel," All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream 

that, uh, you and I, were...",18
Chandler," Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm always surprisingly 

inadequate. (Monica pats him on his lap)",15
Rachel," Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.",12
Ross, I can't believe you two had sex in her dream.,10
Chandler," I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i 

was somebody else's subconscious.",16
Phoebe," (points at Joey's pen) Uh, uh, give me. Can you see me 

operating a drill press?",16
Ross," Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?",10
Phoebe," Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some 

of my massage clients.",15
Phoebe," No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummy. I taught 

this ""massage-yourself-at-home-workshop."" And they are.",16
Phoebe," What... I could, I could do it. What is it?",10
Chandler," Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. 

She is having one of her boobs reduced. (Ross looks at her.) It's a whole big 

boob story.",30
Chandler," Well, you know Pheebs. I don't know if it's your kinda 

thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the 

day.",27
Joey, What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?,10
Monica," Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, 

they're still extinct.'",12
Ross," No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever 

I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.",26
Chandler," A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.",11
Chandler, And this man child has no problem with how old you are?,12
Monica," No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I 

was 22.",16
Phoebe," (with a deep voice) Mr. Bing's office. (Listens) No I'm sorry, 

he's in a meeting right now.",17
Phoebe," Will he know what this is in reference to? (Listens) And he 

has your number? (Listens) All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye 

bye.",27
Phoebe," This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?",11
Phoebe," (playing with a Magic Eight Ball) Most likely. (raises and 

goes toward the door) Okay, I'm gonna be out there.",20
Monica," Windows are clean, candles are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta 

change the belt. Did I turn the fish? (goes over to the kitchen to check on the 

dinner) No, cause I made lasagna. (to Rachel) Am I out of control?",41
Rachel," Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been 

dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are 

you so... Oh.",29
Monica," I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him 

but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.",27
Joey," Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't 

mean...",14
Ross," Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby 

time.",16
Joey," All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be 

cool.",12
Ross," (on phone) Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. (pause) No, André is not 

here. (to Joey) Third time today. (on phone) Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't 

perform those kind of services.",33
Ross," (on phone) Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's 

right, JUMBO with a U, sir. (pause) No, believe me, you don't want me. Judging 

by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. (pause) All rightie, bye bye.",38
Chandler," See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and 

Ross wonder what he means) Me.",19
Phoebe," Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then 

you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like ""Mr. Boss Man"". You know, Mr. 

Bing. Mr. Bing, ""Boss Man Bing"".",35
Phoebe," You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report 

be any later?'",12
Chandler," Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not 

true.",11
Chandler," That is so not... That is so not... 

That... Oh, shut up!",12
Monica," Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, 

so...",13
Monica," Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm 

secretly married to a goat?'",17
Monica," 

Wow…I mean (laughs a little) you’re such a good kisser, I thought you would 

never have known",17
Monica," Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult 

for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can too.",25
Monica," Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and 

thirteen months. ",14
Monica," But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I 

mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.  I 

mean basically, I am nuts about you. You know, I knew it the first time we 

kissed and I had that tic-tac under my tongue and you didn’t even mention it.",53
Monica," Ok...ay.  What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex 

with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.",20
Monica," Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon 

in 48 states. What were you thinking?",19
Monica," Well, fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here; 

it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with 

shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.",35
Ross," (on phone) Okay, André should be there in like 45 minutes.

(Listens) Uh, yes sir the kimonos are extra. 

 All rightie, bye bye. (to Phoebe) Just easier that way.",29
Chandler," Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.",10
Rachel," All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. (Camera 

fades to Ross, who's listening very carefully) Joey was there too.",23
Ross," You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?",10
Joey," So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, 

or you and me and Chandler?",20
Chandler," And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a 

note to get out of gym.",19
Rachel," I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I 

swear. He stopped by.",17
Joey," Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one 

the strongest Power Ranger is?",19
Monica," Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it 

now?",14
Phoebe," Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. (raises) Whoa, oh, head rush. One 

more, and then I have to go. (sits down, and then raises again) Cool!",25
Phoebe," Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.",11
Phoebe," No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, 

them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.",12
Chandler," You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were 

my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different 

person.",27
Phoebe," Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out 

with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.",23
Phoebe," Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek 

that invited the boss.",17
Ross,"  You 

know, this a-this can’t be easy on him either.",10
Ross,"  This 

may take some time for him to get over it, you know? But then at 4 uh, Muppet 

Babies is on. (Monica starts hitting him as both he and Joey laugh.)",32
Chandler," 

(throwing a cushioned football as he stands in his office) Walt go deep. Deep ! 

Deep!


",16
Chandler," Sorry Shelley. (closes the door) 

(to Phoebe) See with the fun? I think last night was great. You know, the 

Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.",29
Phoebe, You were great. But they still made fun of you.,10
Phoebe," You know, now you're more like, you know like, ""Mr. Caring 

Boss,"" ""Mr."", you know, ""I'm one of you, Boss,"" ""Mr., I wanna be your buddy, 

Boss Man Bing!""",29
Phoebe," Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. 

You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires 

them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.",37
Ross," Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it 

means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.",24
Ross," Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our 

cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.",28
Rachel," (understands that Monica and Ethan want to be alone) Hey, did 

you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?",21
Monica," This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, 

I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we 

lived in biblical times, I would really...",37
Chandler," Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need 

them on my desk by nine o'clock.",16
Chandler," You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was 

Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?",21
Chandler," Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working

this weekend.",11
Rachel," (talking in her sleep) Oooooooooh. (Rachel strokes her hand 

over the pillow. Ross mimics her silently) Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!",23
Rachel," You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just...  Wow!",10
Ross," What? (his beeper goes off) Great, now I'm having a baby.",11
Ross," I'm having... I'm having a baby. (jumps back onto the table 

again) I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?",20
Ross," Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.",10
Chandler," (doing a little dance) Hey Ross, look what I've got going 

here. ",12
Rachel," What, so I can't look nice? There might be doctors there.",11
Joey," All right, all right. (he comes out from their apartment with a 

huge sandwich in his hand)",17
Monica," I can't believe it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like 

a nephew.",15
Ross," She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and 

she's not here.",15
Ross," I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already 

passed the mucus plug.",18
Monica," Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?",11
Joey," I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.",10
Chandler," Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie 

from the 50's.",14
Ross," God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.",13
Rachel," Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first 

contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.",20
Phoebe," I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things 

might get musical.",15
Ross," Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, 

you don't stop for Chunkys.",16
Rachel," And if you need anything else, I—(notices the handsome Dr. 

Franzblau)—do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... 

ex-husband's... sister's roommate. ",25
Chandler," Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.",10
Joey," (to the screen) Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. 

That's good too.",14
Joey," The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, 

all right?",13
Joey," Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over 

here! We need a father!",18
Joey," Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to 

be goin' in here.",17
Monica, No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?,12
Chandler," All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one 

of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?",28
Monica," Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?",10
Monica," What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about 

me?",10
Chandler," Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over 

the back of the chair he was sitting in)",19
Rachel," Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has 

uh Dr. Franzblau been by?",17
Rachel," Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. (Pause) What if 

the baby needs him?",17
Chandler," Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, 

like, your father a doctor? ",16
Chandler," No reason. (turns around, makes an 'Oh my God' gesture with 

his eyes)",13
Joey," (takes phone) Hi, yeah, it's me. (Listens) Oh, no no no, we're 

just friends. (Listens) Yeah, I'm single. (Listens) 25. (Listens) An actor. 

(Listens) Hello?",25
Joey," Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I 

mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you 

know?",28
Joey," You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run 

the team.",14
Ross," No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my 

son's name is Jamie.",16
Ross," What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to 

Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole 

Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.",29
Ross," I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.",14
Joey," Ew! What is that? Something exploded! 

That’s not the baby is it?",12
Joey," (panicked) Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water 

breaking?",11
Joey," Ok 

(breathes) I’m ok (breathes), that’s disgusting. (breathes) I’m ok.


",10
Ross," Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.",13
Phoebe," Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My 

god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in 

this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing 

they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!",54
Phoebe," Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.",13
Rachel," No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going 

to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?",25
Rachel," (to Dr. Franzblau) Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about 

Paris, it sounds fascinating.",15
Chandler," 

(looks) I think there’s something sinister going on in here. If you find 

anyone or parts…of anyone, scream.  And scream again.",21
Ross," I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. (Walks 

backwards as if he is going to break down the door, but steps in a bucket and 

falls) Ow.",30
Phoebe," All 

right, all right. Good thing we are in a hospital.",11
Joey," Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, 

harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and 

really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's— (notices the nurse looking at him 

strangely) I was just—yeah, right. Push! Push! ",49
Phoebe," (singing) They found their bodies the very next day, they 

found their bodies the very next...(sees Ross and Susan staring at her) la la la 

la la la.",28
Monica," Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. (Listens) Yeah, 

Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. (Listens) No, he's gone. 

(Listens) No no, you don't have to fly back, really. (Listens) What do you mean 

this might be your only chance? (Listens) Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not 

even thinking about babies yet. ",58
Rachel," (anxiously) No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?",12
Ross," 
You have to do it hard or else it doesn’t… (his 

credit card breaks) Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. (to Susan) This is 

all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, you 

know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck 

in a closet with you.",60
Ross," No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much 

as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you 

get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?",45
Phoebe," I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad 

left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough 

pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has 

like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over 

who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just 

the luckiest baby in the whole world. (pause) I'm sorry, you were fighting.",88
Joey," Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero 

station.",12
Chandler," Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they 

pull her hand off of him) Uh, that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a 

nipple?",26
Phoebe," (reading the nametag on the uniform) Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital 

worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!",18
Ross," Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. 

One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.",19
Phoebe," Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, 

it is in fact a dark vent.",20
Chandler," (to nurse) Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian 

life partner?",15
Ross," Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's 

huge. Carol, how are you doing this?",22
Ross," (puts his head near the baby) Hello! (to Dr. Franzblau) Oh, 

sorry.",12
Ross," We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look 

at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a 

boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.",45
Ross," (to Ben) I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you 

to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.",22
Rachel," Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.",13
Monica," (getting choked up) Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I 

am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.",22
Ross," Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may 

not be around, like this. (walks out of the picture) But I'll still always come 

back, like this. (returns) And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. (walks 

away) But I'll still always come back, like this. (returns) ",54
Chandler," And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go 

like this. (Does a baseball sign.)",17
Joey," Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.",11
Phoebe," Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. (screen goes blank) 

Look, he's opening his eyes. (picture comes back) ",18
Phoebe," Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with

Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of

got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like ""forget about

her"" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in

love with Rachel. She was like, ""Oh my god."" So she went to the airport to meet

him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane

with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough

about us. So, how've you been?",120
Rachel," Oh my god. Oh my god. (She decides to make a break for it.) Excuse me.

Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me! (She tries climbing over a bench and falls down.) ",30
Rachel," Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you? (Hits him with

the flowers.)",17
Rachel," I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr.

Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything. (Looks at Julie)",30
Ross," Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.",12
Rachel," These are, these aren't for you. (to Julie) These are for you. (Loudly,

thinking she can't speak English.) Welcome to our country.",22
Rachel," Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok.

Baggage claim? Ok.",17
Monica," I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with

Ross! ",16
Phoebe," Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all

right, what's bigger than huge?",20
Phoebe," 'Cause, you know, (in that voice) if you don't look good, we don't look

good. I love that voice. (in the voice) Here. And the 

winner is Ava Gardner. ",29
Rachel," (entering, out of breath) Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm

around her. Cramp, cramp.",15
Chandler," Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.",13
Rachel," (to Chandler) You, you, you said he liked me. (Ross and Julie enter)

You, you slowpokes!",16
Ross," That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my

sister Monica. This is Chandler.  Phoebe.  Joey, what up?",23
Rachel," And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away

the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I

can think about.",38
Monica," This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?",10
Ross," But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess

who's in charge of the dig. ",20
Rachel," Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just

kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?",13
Ross," Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the

baby.",17
Chandler," Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like

to be surprised.",15
Rachel, Bye. (She closes the door and everyone tries to sympathize with her.),12
Chandler," So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left

you, you were totally in love with, you know.",24
Ross," I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that

kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?",29
Chandler," Well, maybe it was God, doing me. You 

know, cause aside from being almighty, he's also a wiz of voices. ",20
Ross," Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But

then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never

would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.",47
Rachel," Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge

you for that. ",16
Rachel," Go-go-go-go, come on! (Ross goes over to the counter) (to Chandler) So

uh, what did you find out?",18
Chandler," He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm

sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by

himself!  Without any outside help whatsoever.",36
Ross," Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.",11
Phoebe," Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if

they've changed it? (looks at the expression on Monica) 

Not even close? ",26
Monica," Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I

thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?",20
Phoebe," Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control

freak.",11
Phoebe," I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.",15
Joey," (answering the phone) Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's

Julie, for you. (Throws him the phone.)",20
Rachel," (goes over to the kitchen to talk to 

Monica and Phoebe) (Very angry) Excuse me.  Who gave her our phone number?

",21
Phoebe," Ok well...who had the motive? Was it the 

actor? (points to Joey) The chef? (points to Monica) The masseuse? (points to 

herself) Or was it the guy who's dating her? ",30
Chandler," No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.",14
Joey," Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He

did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. (still confused) All

right, when was 1990?",36
Chandler, Okay.  You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!,10
Ross," (on phone) Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? (Sits

down next to Rachel) Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two,

three. (Doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet) Well you didn't hang up

either. ",49
Rachel," (taking the phone and hanging it up) Sorry, I thought you were talking

to me.",15
Ross," (calls Julie back) Hi?  Sorry, we got disconnected... (Walks away.)",10
Rachel," (to Monica) Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen

to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's

Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.",45
Rachel," I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with

it. (Ross comes by, smooching with Julie on the phone.) I gotta get out of here. (Exits)",28
Chandler," Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.",11
Monica," (to Phoebe) Please, just a little bit off the back.",10
Rachel," (poking her head in from her bedroom) Uh, morning. Do you guys think you

could close your eyes for just a sec?",22
Joey," No-no-no-no-no, (grabs his pants) I'm not fallin' for that again.",10
Rachel," Ok, Paulo, now you've seen everybody and 

better yet they've all seen you. Why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your

way, ok, bye-bye. (Paulo goes into his room.)",34
Rachel," I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.",11
Joey," Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?",14
Monica," My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't...(Everyone

looks at her), but this is about your horrible mistake.",24
Ross," Hi. Sorry we're late but we were—well, there was touching.",10
Phoebe," (to Paulo) Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.",11
Chandler," Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got

pants that need to be altered.",18
Joey," Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.

He'll know what it means.",17
Chandler, Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?,11
Monica," (to Phoebe) You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair

was so much shorter and cuter.",20
Phoebe," All right. Ok, but, but!  You have to promise that you will not be

all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.",23
Phoebe," All right. (Talking to Monica's hair.) Now some of you are gonna get

cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.",30
Phoebe," Yeah, but this (makes Monica's face) isn't the face of a person who

trusts a person. Ok, this (makes Monica's face) is the face of a person who, you know,

doesn't trust a person.",34
Monica," I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we

had discussed.",15
Phoebe, Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.,15
Phoebe," Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.",10
Monica, That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.,11
Phoebe," Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?",11
Monica," She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent

Proposal, Ghost!",10
Monica," I know! That's why I 

wanted to look like her! ",10
Chandler," (standing in front of a 3-way mirror) 

Well, this is what my butt must look like to a fly. ",19
Phoebe," It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.",12
Phoebe," I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. ",11
Phoebe,"  At this point, it's a waiting 

game. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.",21
Phoebe," Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't

you come on in. ",18
Ross,"  Yeah. (Gets up, but then pauses when he realizes what that

meant.)",12
Joey," Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's

one of my gifts.",15
Rachel," When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock

bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.",30
Rachel, Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?,11
Joey," What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been

in love with you for like 10 years.",22
Joey," Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been

with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the

way Ross felt about you.",37
Chandler," (entering, angry) Yo, paesan! Can I talk to you for a sec? (Pause)

Your tailor is a very bad man!",20
Ross," (entering from the bedroom) Hey, what's goin' on? (Pats Chandler on the

shoulder which causes him to jump.)",18
Joey, No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.,11
Chandler," Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand

up my leg, and then, there was definite...",25
Joey," That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over,

then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. (Chandler

and Ross stare at him) What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure

pants?",51
Ross," Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?!",10
Joey," What? That's not? (Realizes) Oh my God. 

(goes to sit down)",11
Ross," I'll put on a pot of coffee. (Pats Joey on 

the shoulder, who then flinches.)",15
Phoebe," Come on. It's not that bad. You never 

know. Bell-bottoms came back in. (Monica rolls her eyes.)",17
Ross," I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten. (Chandler laughs.)",12
Chandler," Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could ""get caught between

the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.""",25
Rachel," (sticking her head in from the balcony) Wait, are you leaving?",11
Chandler," That's ok. If your mechanic does 

it....(nods 'no' very quick with a grimacing smile.) ",14
Rachel," Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a

stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um,

second of all (Ross is laughing), what?",42
Ross," Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those

things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next

day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?",51
Ross," Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I

actually—I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a

guy like that. ",35
Ross," You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets

how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who

wakes up every morning thinking ""Oh my god, I'm with Rachel"". You know, someone

who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. (Rachel has moved closer, but hearing

that she starts to back up.) Was there a second of all?",71
Joey," I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.",11
Phoebe," (to Rachel) Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's

the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?",22
Rachel," No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy

from Planet of the Apes.",19
Monica," (entering from her bedroom carrying a present) Ok, these were

unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20

minutes, but I couldn't resist. (There a little pair of Nike shoes.)",36
Phoebe," Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. (Ben starts to cry)

Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?",25
Chandler," You know, it's... (sees the feeding taking place next to

him) something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. (Goes into the

kitchen)",23
Ross, (following them into the kitchen) What are you guys doing?,10
Ross," Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural

beautiful thing in the world.",16
Joey," Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.",10
Ross," This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so

you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're

uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.",40
Chandler," Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a

question about breast-feeding?",14
Joey," Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the

other one get bigger?",19
Rachel," (to Julie) Thank you. (under her breath to Chandler) What a

bitch.",12
Phoebe," I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.",11
Joey," Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What

about Rachel?",13
Chandler," Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with

Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.",18
Phoebe," Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in

the street.",15
Ross," (to Monica) So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping

tomorrow?",13
Ross," It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really

appreciate this.",14
Joey," (A guy walks by) Bijan for men? (Another guy walks by) Bijan

for men? (Another guy walks by) Bijan for men? (An attractive woman walks by.)

Hey Annabelle.",28
Joey," Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that

everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.",20
Monica," Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all

day.",12
Phoebe," Oh, all had a salad right. What did I have?",10
Phoebe," I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.",12
Phoebe," Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we

bought some, (sees Monica pointing at her chest) uh, boobs.",23
Phoebe," (Monica is yanking on her bra strap) Bras! We bought bras! We

bought bras. ",14
Joey," (to a guy) Bijan for men? (to a guy) Bijan for men? (To a

woman) Bijan for... (Sees it's a woman and stops.) (To Annabelle who walks up.)

Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could

go maybe grab a cup of coffee.",50
Joey," (To a co-worker) Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to

a cowboy spraying cologne. (A customer walks by.) Bijan for men? (The customer

ignores him, and Joey starts to chase him) Bijan for men?! ",38
Ross," Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time.

We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.",22
Rachel," (hold ups a t-shirt that says “My Mommies Love Me”) Oh, this

is so cute.",15
Monica," Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju—(Sees Rachel is watching)—Hi, Jew! (Walks into

the kitchen.) (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens) Ok. (Listens) Um,

sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye. (Hangs up.)",32
Monica," Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. He’s going through this whole religion thing. Yeah,

he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.",25
Ross," Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you,

because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.",21
Phoebe," Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. (Squirts

some on her wrist and tastes it.)",19
Ross," Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on

it.",14
Monica," Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with

me. Thanks for your jacket.",16
Rachel," Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. (Puts her hand

in the pocket) Here are your keys, hon. (She takes the keys out, sets them on

the counter, and notices she also grabbed a receipt.)",38
Rachel," Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it

cost you uh 53 dollars?",16
Monica," You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my

credit card.",11
Rachel, And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?,10
Rachel," Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?",10
Monica," Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her

because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another

and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.",33
Monica," Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to

me.",13
Monica," Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look,

I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!",23
Rachel," Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. (Waves the receipt)",10
Rachel," Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?",12
Monica, Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?,13
Rachel," Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with

her to Bloomingdale's? (Monica looks away.) Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just

really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now. (Exits.)",39
Monica," (on the phone) Hi, who's this? (Listens) Hi, Joanne. Is

Rachel working? It's Monica. (Listens) Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.

(Listens) Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? (Listens) No, I don't

care what Steve thinks. (Listens) Hi, Steve.",44
Ross," No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just

don't think breast milk is for adults.",19
Chandler," Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids

alike.",11
Ross," (he rolls up his sleeve) Gimme the bottle. (Joey hands him the

bottle and Ross squirts some on his arm.) Gimme the towel. (Joey gives him the

towel and he wipes it off.) ",33
Joey," (sitting on the other side of the counter from Chandler) Gimme

a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.",22
Joey," Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put

more people on it. (Chandler pours some juice in a glass.) You should see this

guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.",36
Chandler," (slides the juice across the counter which Joey catches)

What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to

mean anything to you.",29
Joey," I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best.

(He downs the glass of juice in one swig.) I don't know. Maybe I should just get

outta the game. They need guys up in house wares to serve cheese.",44
Chandler," (pours more and slides the refill to Joey) All right, say

you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a

better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?",34
Chandler," You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what

you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are

the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.",36
Joey, I'm gonna do it. (He downs the juice in one swig again.),12
Chandler," All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with

a nice hooker.",16
Monica," Rachel, (they go back inside) say that I'm friends with her,

we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?",20
Rachel," Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's

stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with,

but now, she's actually (starting to cry), but now she's actually stealing you.",40
Monica," Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from

you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends

with you. I mean, (starting to cry) you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.",39
Phoebe," You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to

do with me, but um I love you guys too. (Joins in on the hug.) Oh, I really

needed that. (Goes and sits down.)",36
Monica," Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you

really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she

was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you

gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?",62
Phoebe," Wait, wait, wait, wait! (Runs over and joins in on the hug

again.)",13
Joey," These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they

all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee

now?",26
Rachel," So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I

mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one

of the two of us, though, right?",36
Rachel," Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started

going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna

bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how

good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are,

and god I hate it when she's right.",69
Chandler," They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.",11
Chandler," I'm tellin' you, she leaned back; I could see her brain.",11
Monica," How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the

most superficial insignificant things?",15
Joey," Hold it, hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When

I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really

hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.",44
Ross," I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.",10
Joey," That was a good one. For a second there, I was like,

""whoa.""",13
Phoebe," You name one woman that you broke up with for a actual real

reason.",14
Ross," ""’Cause she doesn’t hate Yanni,"" is not a real

reason.",10
Chandler," Okay, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't

about being picky.",13
Joey," (doing Janice) ""Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There,

faster!"" (He turns around and everyone is staring at him.)",19
Phoebe," Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the

building. (Screaming) Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!",20
Phoebe," I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. (Everyone groans)

That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know there're a lot of things that I don't

believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.",34
Ross," Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in

evolution?",12
Phoebe," I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you

know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.",24
Ross," Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this

planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, is-is too

easy?",22
Ross," Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe.

Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like

gravity.",24
Phoebe," Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in

it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not

so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.",38
Chandler," Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed. Quick Pheebs, hop on the ceiling.",13
Monica," I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us.

I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even

knowing it?",28
Monica," Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final

revenge!",14
Chandler," Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of

crap",11
Joey," Check this out. Can I have this? (It’s a giant magnifying glass

on a stand.)",15
Ross," Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I

can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually

show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them

evolving through time.",40
Phoebe," Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils

there, and why?",14
Chandler," (holding a book) Hey, look at this. ""My Big Book of

Grievances.""",12
Joey," Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes

homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.",21
Chandler," April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate

comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.",16
Rachel," Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. (She’s holding a lamp made

from seashells.) Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.",23
Rachel," What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girlie clock

or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool. (It’s a girl in a

bikini and pasties standing behind an alarm clock.)",37
Rachel," You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?",10
Rachel," Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just

somebody who rents a room.",18
Rachel," Ok, while you ""mmm"" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go

find a place for my new lamp.",18
Ross," Ok, Pheebs. (He’s holding two little toys.) See how I'm making

these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain

opposable thumbs?",25
Phoebe," Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I

don't.",13
Ross," No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because it’s

like math.  One plus one equals two. I

can’t stand by and let you think that one plus one might equal three or four or

yellow!",34
Phoebe,"  Why not? What is this obsessive need you have to

make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe

it's time you put Ross under the microscope.",33
Ross, (To Chandler) Is there blood coming out of my ears?,10
Joey," Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.",10
Joey," ""Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the

funniest kid in school.""",14
Chandler," Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. (There’s

a banging coming from upstairs.) He was right. Would you listen to that?",24
Chandler," Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And

he was in the scale modeler’s club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I

sure thought they were cool.",32
Chandler," I just think it's weird, you know? (The banging is back.)

Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles… (He picks up the broom and

bangs on the ceiling) Would you knock it off? (Everyone stares) (Realizes) Bah!

(He throws the broom down.)",44
Chandler," Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went

out with. Look what he wrote on them. (As he mentions each name and description,

he hands a picture to Joey.) Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too

smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm

gonna end up alone, just like he did.",66
Chandler," Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm

coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town.

Aloneville. Hermit Junction.",29
Joey," All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta

here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.",22
Chandler," What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found

her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it ‘supposebly?’",22
Joey," I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.",10
Chandler," You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married,

and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married,

will you invite me over for holidays?",33
Joey," Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I

mean, what if we're at her folks' place?",21
Joey," You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all

right?",13
Chandler," You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you

man. (exits)",15
Chandler," Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to

comprehend?",11
Chandler," Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared

about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.",21
Chandler, You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?,10
Monica," Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?",11
Rachel," Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.",10
Ross," Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual

scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are

over 200 million years old.",30
Phoebe," Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution,

ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.",20
Phoebe," Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok?

(Holding her thumb and forefinger close together) Wasn't there a time when the

brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like

what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you

split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling

me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a

teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this? (Monica and Rachel

are intrigued.)",100
Phoebe," You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before,

I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you

going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other

science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? (Ross slowly closes the

briefcase and walks out hugging it.) Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?",68
Monica," Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was

putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.",26
Rachel," Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then,

all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?",18
Phoebe," Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but

I uh want to believe you.",19
Chandler," Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a

snake.",14
Chandler," If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing,

you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I

figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y’know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get

more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run.

""Run away from Crazy Snake Man,"" they'll shout!",68
Monica, You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.,13
Chandler," Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to

actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any

great women out there.",31
Rachel," Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we

have ever gone out with.",15
Rachel," She's right. I mean you all do

it. Th-this one guy stopped seeing me because because his cat didn’t like me",21
Phoebe,"

Or, this guy dumped me because I fell asleep during Spinal Tap",12
Rachel," (to

Monica) Oh oh and Teddy, what’s his name, in high school stopped seeing

you because he thought you were too fat. ",22
Monica,"  He told me it was because he didn’t have time

for me because of the play. ",16
Rachel," But but that’s what I said.

Anyway my point being is you are no different than the rest of them.",20
Monica," Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally

different.",13
Monica," No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now.

Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to

be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.",35
Phoebe," Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be

with someone!",13
Rachel," What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you

can break?",13
Monica," No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I

think it'll look good in our apartment.",22
Chandler," Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a

date tomorrow night. This woman Alison, from work, she's great. She's pretty.

She's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past,

because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang

me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.",63
Chandler," Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I

think somebody should have it.",16
Monica," Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this

apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just

took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but

he was a person. (She ends up standing behind the magnifying glass and everyone

is laughing.) (Realizes.)You're all going to hell.",69
Chandler," Yeah, just second. (Ross exits and Chandler picks up the

broom and leans it up against the wall.) Good-bye Mr. Heckles. (He turns off

the lights.) We'll try to keep it down.",32
Rachel," Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the,

the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop

worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing (a

pigeon flies in the window and lands on the table) Oh my Goood,

oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. (hangs up) OK, that's fine,

you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. (grabs a pot

and lid) OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle

comedy. (puts pot over the pigeon) Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my

God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. (knock at the door)

It's open you guys.",141
Rachel," Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.",14
Rachel," What? (in surprise she forgets she has the pigeon in the pot

and lets it get away)",17
Phoebe," Well, I mean, I'm not married, married, ya know,

he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a

green card.",28
Monica," I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not

tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.",22
Phoebe," I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really,

like, judgemental and you would not approve.",20
Monica," Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in

love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you

thinking?",27
Phoebe," OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a

friend.",15
Monica," Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a

month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.",20
Phoebe," Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear

out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun

Bobby out on the terrace.",33
Monica," Wait a minute, who told you? (turns to Chandler who's looking

sheepish) You are dead meat.",16
Monica," Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines

as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple!",23
Chandler," (walks into the living room) C'mon, there's nothin' to see,

it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.",18
Joey, I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.,11
Joey," I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought

that's what it was. Let me see it again.",21
Joey," Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a

job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be

the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin'

sex on it.",48
Chandler," Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery

entrance to the magical land of Narnia.",17
Chandler," Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the

tri-state area?",13
Ross," You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't

know? ",13
Rachel," (to Monica at the counter) Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so

special. What, does she go and put on an outfit at

night and fight crime?",26
Monica," Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you

did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.",29
Rachel," Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know

that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.

Ohhh, I’m going to have to write that down on my hand. ",37
Phoebe," Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the

Garden, he's in the Capades.",16
Chandler," No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast

but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.",18
Monica," I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're

just, you're setting yourself up all over again.",19
Phoebe," OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can

put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because

I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.",40
Ross," (holding cream pitcher) Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk.

(holds pitcher in front of Chandler's chest and flips the lid) Hey Chandler,

would you fill me up here?",29
Chandler," Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha

ha ha. . . ",17
Ross," OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before

ha, have, having the sex?",15
Rachel," Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are

you and, are you and Julie not having sex?",22
Rachel," Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it

'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?",25
Ross," No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything.

I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like

uhh. . .",31
Rachel," No, no no no, don't need to know the details.",10
Ross," It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one

woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself

all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . .

Well, you just must think I'm weird.",53
Rachel," No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think

umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?",23
Rachel," Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier

than a man who does not want to have sex.",22
Rachel," Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait

some more.",14
Rachel," Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I

don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with,

with another man. That just means it's working.",37
Rachel," More than jewelry. (Rachel struts off, extremely pleased with

herself)",10
Phoebe," Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonderful, huh. Mr. major

capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's

Ice is Nice.",28
Phoebe," Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.",11
Ross," Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks. (hands her a

bowl and kisses her)",16
Chandler," Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's

gone now, you're all right.",16
Ross," (pulls Rachel aside) I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh,

our little talk before.",17
Rachel," Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting

thing?",13
Ross," Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to

Joey.",15
Ross," Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya

know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and,

well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .",41
Chandler, What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.,10
Joey," I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled

with two nippled people. (Chandler puts the tape in)",22
Rachel," Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.",11
Rachel," Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh,

degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering.

And, Monica help me out here.",29
Chandler," OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test

I've ever seen.",14
Ross, Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.,10
Joey," Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the

copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . .

so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, (Joey from

TV) you know that's bad for the paper tray.",59
Joey," Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the

guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there

I am. . .",34
Phoebe," So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.",11
Phoebe," I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I

mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award

parties.",27
Phoebe," Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?",12
Phoebe," I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married

to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh,

I'm not gay.'",33
Phoebe, Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?,11
Chandler," Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.",10
Rachel," No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's

only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.",27
Rachel," Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now

and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like,

what don't you like? We wanna know everything.",37
Rachel," So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know

Julie?",15
Monica," Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? (Rachel gives her a

look from hell) That's fine.",18
Rachel," OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was

that like?",13
Phoebe," (handing him the papers) Here you go. You know what, I just

have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had

been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm

sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.",60
Rachel," So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning

on. . .",13
Rachel," Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean,

are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna

pounce?",31
Ross," I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.",14
Rachel," Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you

know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn

hard to recover from.",31
Ross," No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent

last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually

happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna

mess it up, ya know.",49
Rachel," Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean,

maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing.

I mean, women really like that.",32
Rachel," Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you

know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with

like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe

um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that

let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.",75
Rachel," And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to

you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um,

it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.",44
Ross," Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight. (goes back in apartment)",10
Ross," Twice (walks into Central Perk as

the two old ladies remain speechless)",12
Chandler," Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes,

I see how you got there. (The phone rings and Chandler doesn't answer it.)",22
Chandler," No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I

figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life.

My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned. ",31
Chandler," Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. (To Ross) I

love her.",15
Chandler," Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you

know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?",18
Chandler, Ok. (He hangs up.) Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.,12
Ross," Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when

she sees you tomorrow, she's probably gonna realize, ""Hey, you're not

Bob.""",24
Chandler,"

(with a Spanish accent) Ahh you see Tatoo…Ms. Jade’s fantasy is to rekindle the

love she once had with Bob.",20
Ross," You

know what my fantasy is? That you talk like a normal person.",13
Chandler," I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek

comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.",24
Chandler," Ok, pure evil (holds up his left hand), horny and alone

(holds up his right hand). I've done this (He shakes his right hand.)",24
Ross," Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie

in New Mexico.",13
Chandler," Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks

for his birthday.",15
Phoebe," Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? Y'know,

like from, like 20?",15
Chandler," Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.",12
Rachel," Yeah, whoosh! (Imitates going over a cliff with her hand.)",10
Chandler," I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.",10
Ross," Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. (He hangs up) (To

Chandler) Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through

with this, are you?",28
Rachel," So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?",10
Joey," Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I

guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.",22
Rachel," Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those

guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?",26
Joey," Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying ""let's go here,

let's go there"". Like we can afford to go here and there.",22
Phoebe," Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, y'know,

someplace nice, y'know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it,

'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.",34
Monica," I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti,

sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It

turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.",40
Monica," Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing,

thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and

they think we should go out and celebrate. Y'know, someplace nice. (She goes

into her bedroom.)",41
Joey,  How much do you think I can get for my kidney? ,11
Chandler," Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with

conventional methods.",14
Ross," That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we

know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's

chance for happiness.",31
Chandler," We don't know Bob!  Okay? We know me. We like me.

Please let me be happy.",16
Chandler," All right. (He gets up, but swings around the pole back to

their table.)",14
Chandler," Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess

something.",14
Chandler," I don't know. (He sits down.) I just had this weird sense.

You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue? (Holds out one of

this small packs.)",29
Chandler," No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.",10
Ross," Ok, (holding up his glass) ok, here is to my sister, the

newly-appointed head lunch chef...",16
Ross," Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of

purchasing...",12
Monica, Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.,10
Ross," Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not

there. Here's to my little sister--",16
Chandler," Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. (to Ross) I'm

not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?",20
Ross," (to Chandler behind their menus) Well, pretty incredible

according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this

woman leaving a message for you on my machine?",32
Chandler," Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number,

because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks

that my number is Bob's number.",33
Ross," Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?",12
Monica," Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the

grilled prawns. ",14
Joey," Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get

it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?",24
Rachel," Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my

water?",15
Phoebe," Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take

care.",14
Chandler," Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're

gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?",17
Chandler,"  Woah! Did anybody feel like they just

gave birth to an alien?",12
Ross," (using calculator) Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes

28 bucks.",12
Phoebe," No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.",10
Phoebe," I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but

cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had

that-that-that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...",32
Ross," Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's

no big deal.",16
Rachel," (to Joey and Phoebe) Ok, look you guys, I really don't want

to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.",25
Joey," (clearing his throat a lot) Ok, um, uh, we three feel like,

that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh... (Pause) We don't have as much

money as you.",30
Ross," Well umm I, I just never think of money as an issue.",12
Chandler," So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?",11
Joey," 'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like with Monica's new

job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.",17
Ross," Wha—Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any

kind of negative—there's gonna be a hoopla?",20
Rachel," Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff

after the thing.",12
Monica," If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the

thing, and we'll just do the gift.",19
Chandler," No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the

Blowfish.",13
Ross," Hootie and the—oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.",12
Phoebe," No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.",11
Ross," No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is

that we all be together.",16
Monica," Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for

Phoebe. ",12
Monica," Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys

gave me the steaks as sort of a thank you.",21
Ross," But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?",11
Chandler," (to the others) By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in

the hall.",14
Chandler," Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! (Pause)

The Blowfish!",12
Monica," It's on us, all right; so don't worry. It's our treat.",11
Joey," Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like...",12
Rachel," Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel

this big. (Holds her thumb and forefinger a short distance apart.)",23
Phoebe," Actually, it makes us feel that big. (She squeezes Rachel's

thumb and forefinger closer together.)",15
Ross," I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't

win with you guys.",16
Chandler," If you guys feel this big (imitates Rachel's gesture),

maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.",20
Phoebe," I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a

very Hootie place right now.",18
Phoebe," Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats y'know, for all your

tiaras and stuff.",14
Chandler, (to Phoebe) Why did you look at me when you said that?,12
Rachel," What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have

to do everything together?",18
Monica," All right. We're gonna go. (Exits, then comes back in) It's

not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.",20
Chandler," Yes. Yes! Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex

today.",15
Chandler," Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I

was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming. ",23
Chandler," Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.",14
Chandler, I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.,12
Chandler," Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that

you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.",26
Monica, You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.,11
Ross," Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.",11
Ross," Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.",11
Chandler," Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them (the band) for us to

leave now.",16
Monica," You know, the guys are probably having a great time.",10
Joey," (holding a hand behind his back) Come on you guys, one more

time.",13
Joey, Nooo. (He brings out his hand and is holding up two fingers.),12
Ross," Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?",12
Monica," Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little

Stevie Fisher. Remember him?",16
Rachel," Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?",11
Ross," Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.",12
Joey," Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is so stupid.",12
Phoebe," We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like

money get—(notices something on Monica's neck)—Is that a hickey?",20
Ross," It wasn't so much a party as a...a gathering of people, with

food, and music, and, and the band.",19
Chandler," Yes, apparently Stevie and Hootie are like this. (Holds up

crossed fingers.)",12
Phoebe," Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just

like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out

like partying and having fun, and you know, all, ""Hey, Blowfish, suck on

my neck"".",40
Ross," Look, don't blame us. You guys could have been there, you know.",12
Monica," Oh great, it's work. (To Ross) Can you hand me that? (Ross

hands her the phone.)",16
Chandler," I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money

than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.

",29
Monica," (on phone) Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.",11
Chandler," I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that

costs a little more.",15
Monica," Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. (They quiet down.) Wait, I don't

understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a

kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. (Listens)

What corporate policy? (Listens)   No. (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Okay.

(Hangs up) I just got fired.",54
Joey, (grabs the check) Let me get that. (To Chandler) You got five bucks?,13
Monica," Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy,

yes. (Ben starts crying.) Don't cry. Don't cry. (To Ross) Why is he still

crying?",23
Ross," Come

on, nothing that can’t be solved by happy keys! (takes them out and starts

rattling them in Ben’s face)",20
Joey," Yeah,

I always feel much better when someone shakes jagged metal in my face. ",14
Ross," (puts his keys away) All right here,

let me hold him for a sec. There. (Ben stops crying) Huh? There we are.",22
Ross, Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.,11
Chandler," You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl,

kinda moody.",12
Ross, There we go. All better. (gives Ben back to Monica),10
Chandler," Can I uh see something? (Takes Ben. When he puts him close

to Monica, Ben cries. When he moves Ben away, he stops crying. He does that a

couple times.)",30
Monica," He hates me. My nephew hates me. I’m

unemployed and my nephew hates me.",14
Monica, What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?,14
Chandler," Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long

it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you

don't even have a boyfriend yet. (Monica glares at him.) Joey, she does not

look fat.",43
Monica," (to Chandler) Here you go. (Sets a drink down in front of

him.)",13
Chandler," Oh hey Monica. (He holds the basketball in front of

Monica.)",11
Joey," (imitating Ben) Waah!! (Chandler moves the basketball away)

Goo, goo, goo. (Chandler moves the basketball in front of Monica again.) Waaah!",21
Monica," That is so funny. Let me see that a sec. (She throws the ball

out the window)",17
Ross, Kiwi? Kiwi? You said it was a key lime pie.,10
Monica," No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so

special. ",13
Ross, And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.,10
Monica," No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts

and...",11
Monica," All right, get your coat, we're gonna go to the hospital.",11
Ross," (sitting back down) You know, you know, actually it's getting

better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?",21
Ross, What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.,11
Joey," What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of

hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?",21
Chandler," Well, I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I

guess that's out the window.",15
Ross," Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna

bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers

in the bag.",31
Phoebe," Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing

this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.",21
Phoebe," (singing) I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop

me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled

backward is Nirget.",31
Rachel," Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot

do this to her.",18
Rachel," Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?",17
Phoebe," (singing) Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse,

repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat...as needed.",13
Chandler," You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you

forget to pack the baby's anvil?",17
Joey," It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love

babies, all right? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive

thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will

break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme

the baby.",59
Joey," Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his

head.",14
Joey, (to Chandler) What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?,10
Phoebe," But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is

written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.",27
Phoebe," And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just

give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a

ball on top.",32
Rachel," Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying

""Terry's a jerk!"" That's where that came from.",18
Rachel," Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do.

(She goes over to Terry.) All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go

on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You

don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.",51
Rachel," Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I

will cleeeean it.",17
Phoebe, Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?,14
Phoebe, Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.,11
Rachel," Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other

woman because she's a professional.",18
Phoebe," Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.",12
Phoebe," No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy

second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city

where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. ",37
Phoebe," (singing, angrily) When I play, I play for me, I don't

need your charity. (Someone puts a coin in her guitar case) Thank you! La

la la la la la la....",31
Ross," Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take

the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun. ",27
Monica,"

Wait, why don’t we just wait and see what the doctor says.",12
Ross,"

Well they’ve got to be able to do thomething. I mean these are the 90s!",15
Monica," Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother

has a slight phobia about needles.",18
Ross, (to Monica) Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?,11
Monica," My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to

treat this orally. ",16
Monica," That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a

needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?",28
Monica," Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand?

",13
Monica," Okay. (He grabs her hand.) All right, Ross, don't squeeze it

so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! (The doctor puts in the

needle.) Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!",33
Chandler," That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women,

we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!",24
Joey," Hey, hey, look at that talent. (Motions to two girls waiting

for the bus.)",14
Chandler," Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too

pink.",13
Joey," Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys,

hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight

guy stuff.",27
Joey," Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh

sidewalk.",13
Joey," Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we

uh, get together for a drink?",18
Chandler," Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.",11
Monica, Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts?,11
Ross," Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got

my s's back…which we can celebrate later. Celebrate. ",20
Phoebe," (singing) ... with the double double double-jointed boy.

(A woman carrying a guitar case walks up.) Hey. So um, are you the professional

guitar player?",25
Phoebe," Right. My name was on there (The chalk sign out front), but

now it just says ""carrot cake"". So, um, so um, how many chords do you

know?",28
Phoebe," Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?",12
Phoebe," Oh. Mine does. (singing) Stephanie knows all the chords.

(makes a face)",12
Chandler," (on pay phone) Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit

Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what

someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. (Listens) Yes I do realize

that would be a very stupid character.",49
Joey," (grabbing the phone) Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on

a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller.

Oh, and there was a baby in it. (Listens) (to Chandler) He wants to talk to you

again.",45
Rachel," Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome

to...",12
Phoebe," (outside singing angrily) Terry's a jerk, and he won't

let me work, and I hate Central Perk!",17
Chandler," Actually, uh, we're both the father. (Puts his arm around

Joey)",11
Chandler, Please tell me you know which one is our baby.,10
Joey," Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has

clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.",20
Joey," Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he

had that cute little mole by his mouth.",19
Joey," Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.",11
Rachel," Here. I thought you might be cold. (Hands her a cup of

coffee.)",13
Phoebe," Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in

the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel

better.",29
Phoebe," No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for

me. You know, I don't know, when I sang ""Su-Su-Suicide,"" I got a

dollar seventy-five. But then, ""Smelly Cat,"" I got 25 cents and a

condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.",49
Rachel," Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly

Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then,

whoosh! (Waves her hand over her head.)",32
Phoebe," It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me

happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.",25
Rachel," Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was

actually a request for ""Smelly Cat.""",17
Rachel," Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but

it's my favorite.",16
Ross," I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm

sorry I,I almost broke your hand.",19
Ross," Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your

hand?",12
Monica," Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle? (Points to

her hand.)",14
Monica," Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the

Silvian's pumpkin?",15
Ross," Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike

spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb? ",24
Ross," I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the

legs off your Malibu Ken?",19
Monica," Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my

little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. (She picks him up.) Hey, he's not crying.",25
Ross," I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your

diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?",24
Ross," Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus—Hey, I have a question. How come

it says Property of Human Services on his butt?",21
Ross," (to Monica) Will you hold Ben for a sec? (Hands Ben off and

starts to chase Joey and Chandler.) Come here. Come here.",23
Chandler," (picking up the pie) Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey,

Run!",12
Phoebe," No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's ""smelly cat, smel-ly cat.""",10
Phoebe," Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because

it's a hard song.",15
Phoebe," Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why

don't you just follow me?",18
Ross," Yeah.

This one's cute and-and that one's cute (points to a cat) and

that one's cute. (points to another cat). They're all cute.

They're kittens. Let's just wrap it up and get the hell out of

here.",37
Ross," Yeah I

know. I know. (to the worker) So um, do you have any cats that

are really old or incredibly sick? Just--",23
Ross," Oh see,

now we should of worked that out before we came down here.",14
Ross," Oh well

I um..I don't know. I mean it's not that easy to choose. You

know? I mean both-both cats are-are beautiful and um..funny

and....you know I am sure I would be happy with either cat. I-I

just..",38
Ross," Both? Both?

I can't have two cats-I mean..Joey's the kind of guy who can have

two cats.",17
Phoebe," Ok, all right. We want to

hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this

end well or do we need to get tissues?",28
Monica," (getting the wine) Do not

start without me. Do not start without me.",13
Phoebe," Ok, all right, let's hear

about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was

it like a, you know, a ""I gotta have you now"" kind of thing?",36
Rachel,"   Well, at

first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort

of sunk into it.",22
Phoebe," Ok, so, ok, was he

holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?",15
Rachel,"  No, actually first they started on my

waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.",20
Chandler," All right, check out

this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in

spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.",27
Monica," (reading the paper) There

are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.",13
Joey," (reading over her shoulder)

Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?",15
Joey," No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be

willing to dance naked. And then... (rubs his fingers together)",22
Ross," That, that is funny. That

is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful",15
Ross," Yeah, it was, but...I get

home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking

to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with

Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me,

and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?",65
Chandler," Ahh,

I’m the same way. Show me a bottle of Visine and I am like “Woah, who am I!”. ",19
Ross," Believe me, I've been dreaming

about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me

and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... (Rachel enters, carrying a

tray)... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.",40
Ross," Hi, Julie. (nervous) Hi,

Julie. Julie, um, how are you?",10
Ross," (uncomfortable) Good, so

everybody's here. Everybody's good…..good and great

in here! So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?",18
Phoebe," Ok, um, hi, hello, hi,

ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I

made up. Um, it's called, um, ""Two of Them Kissed Last Night"". ",33
Phoebe," (singing) There was a girl,

we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this

point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will

be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or

will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide,

even though I made him up, he must decide!",76
Monica," Ashame

that it’s true. (laughs a bit) I’m kidding. I’m kidding. No it’s all true.  I’m just a little a little nervous,

that’s all.  I’m fine now. So,

Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.",41
Monica," (disgusted, trying not to

show it) I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.",18
Monica," Abso...(swallows

hard)...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And,

well, now, I love Mockolate.",17
Monica," Especially the after

taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.",14
Rachel,"  Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with

Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, ""Hi,

I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids

and dig up stuff together.""",44
Ross," I don't know what to do.

What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.",20
Chandler," Oh, I know. This must

be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My

wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.",33
Ross,"  Oh hey, I-I think I know what it is

‘Help’. ",10
Chandler," Ok, all right, look.

Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and

cons.  (eyes Joey to stop touching

his computer) Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I

can use different colors for each column.",46
Joey," Ok, let's start with the

cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.",14
Ross," I don't know. I mean, all

right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.",17
Ross," And I guess, you know,

sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too

into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both

paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.",43
Chandler," Waitress. Got it. You

guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?",16
Monica," Ok, this is pumpkin pie

with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these

are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.",26
Rachel,"  Oh my god, I can't believe you let me

put this in my mouth.",14
Phoebe," Oh, oh sweet Lord! This

is what evil must taste like!",11
Chandler," I'm telling you this

thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a

hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you

watching Star Trek?",38
Joey," (to Ross) Hey, so how'd it

go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?",16
Ross," Yes, it was horrible. She

cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.",20
Ross," I uh, I just got back from

uh, from Julie's.",10
Ross," No, no, uh, it's not what

you think. It's um the other thing.",13
Joey," He broke up with Julie.

Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.",12
Ross," I know, I know, it's, it's almost...(turns

around, sees Chandler and Joey) What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not

them?",25
Rachel,"  Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's

goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is

unbelievable. (notices Chandler's computer screen) What's that?",31
Rachel,"  What's that? What? I saw my name. What is

it?",10
Chandler," No, no, see? See? (the

printer starts to run) Hey, it's printing. (to Joey, rattled) Hey, it's

printing!",18
Rachel,"  Ross, Chandler wrote something about me

on his computer and he won't let me see.",15
Ross," He won't? (remembers what

it is) He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were

writing?",20
Chandler," Yes, yes it is, short

story, that I was writing.",10
Chandler," (through gritted teeth)

Alright. (clears his throat) ""It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was

there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his

forever. The end.""",34
Ross," That's it? That's all you

wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.",14
Rachel,"  All right, you know what? This isn't

funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to

see it.",24
Rachel,"  All right, you know what, that's fine. If

you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it.

(Rachel grabs the paper and runs across the room, reading it to herself.)",38
Ross," Ok, just, just remember how

crazy I am about you, ok?",11
Ross," Now that's a little

spoiled. He was supposed to type ""little"", the idiot.",13
Ross," No, that, that was, I mean,

as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?",18
Ross," No, no, wait, ok, ok, look

at the other side. Look at Julie's column.",14
Rachel,"  She is not Rachem. What the

hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know

because I'm just a waitress.",24
Ross," No, Rach, come on. Rach!

Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?",17
Chandler," My diary! My diary,

that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have

made me read her my diary.",25
Monica," You know, that's true.

You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.",17
Phoebe," I... I cannot believe

Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.",12
Chandler," (squirming) All right,

let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.",16
Chandler," All right, Pheebs, back

me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?",16
Phoebe," Yeah, by the way, good

luck in your next life as a dung beetle.",14
Rachel,"  (coldly) When somebody does not buzz you

in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire

escape.",22
Monica," Oh, you must be freezing.

You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?",19
Ross," Rach, come on, open up.

Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.",18
Rachel,"  No, you guys, you really don't have to

go, we're done talking.",12
Ross," Rach, come on, look, I know

how you must feel.",10
Rachel,"  (near tears) No, you don't, Ross.

Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if

the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too,

but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.",47
Ross," No, but, but I wanna be

with you in spite of all those things.",14
Rachel,"  Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of

you, Ross. (to the others) I said don't go!",16
Ross," You know what? You know

what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a

list that would ever make me not want to be with you.",32
Rachel,"  Well, then, I guess that's the

difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.",15
Joey," (quietly) I never know how long

you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again,

you know? (Ross stares blankly at him) Maybe a little longer.",32
Monica," Now, in some of these

recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut

mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups

of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.",41
Rachel,"  (to Monica) Is that him again? Tell him

I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.",20
Monica," (to Ross) Listen, I... I

don't think this is the best time.",12
Monica," Sure, what? Ok, ok.

(hangs up the phone) (to Rachel) Music?",11
Monica," Oh, not at all. I have no

morals and I need the cash.",13
Phoebe,"

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you

should see the size of his Christmas Balls.


[Chandler and Joey enter.]",28
Joey,"

Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?",11
Chandler,"

Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look

bad.",17
Monica,"

Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.",10
Monica,"

Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . All right, we're

broke, but cookies do say that.",20
Phoebe,"

I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.",13
Chandler,"

Pheebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?",12
Phoebe,"

Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.",13
Ross,"

So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?",10
Rachel,"

Uhh, the mailman, the super.


[There's a bang at the door.]",11
Monica,"

Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.


[Joey opens the door and picks up the remnants of the newspaper.",18
Joey,"

Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.


[Joey shows them the torn-up newspaper.]",14
Rachel,"

Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.",11
Ross,"

Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is

bitemebitemebitemebiteme.",12
Joey,"

I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin'

turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are

a-layin'.",29
Chandler,"

Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.


[Ross enters with several bags from shopping.]",18
Ross,"

Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. [Rachel is not impressed]. . I'll

open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. [sings] Walks down stairs, alone or

in pairs, everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still

mad at me becuase of the whole. . .",51
Rachel,"

Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?",11
Ross," How 'bout from now on we

just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? [Rachel walks off] Hey Gunther,, you got stairs in your

place?",23
Ross,"

Here, go nuts. [gives him the Slinky and goes and sits with others at the

couches]",16
Joey,"

C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.",13
Ross,"

[childishly] OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.",14
Ross,"

I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this

blouse for mom.


[Ross holds up the blouse. It is extremely tacky, with sewn-on medals hanging

off of it.]",36
Monica,"

Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best

dressed at the make-believe military academy.


[Phoebe enters.]",22
Phoebe,"

Happy Christmas Eve Eve. [sees Ross's picture frame] Oh my God, where did you

get this?",16
Phoebe,"

This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.",11
Chandler,"

Nah, Pheebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.",10
Phoebe,"

No it isn't, this is my dad, all right, I'll show you.",12
Phoebe,"

No, that's my step dad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was

born.",19
Phoebe,"

[showing her pictures] OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this

picture before she died, same guy.",20
Monica,"

Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue

screen with a collie.",21
Phoebe," It's not a blue screen...

it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my Grandmother. [turns to leave]",26
Joey,"

So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .",15
Phoebe,"

Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?",12
Phoebe,"

OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.",12
Phoebe," Ya know, in all the years

that we have been ",10
Phoebe,"

All right, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he

doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?",27
Phoebe,"

OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?",12
Chandler,"

Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black

boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want

anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and

wake everybody up.",46
Ross,"

Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas

shopping?",13
Monica,"

You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya

gonna do?",14
Chandler,"

Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?",11
Rachel,"

Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the

ornaments your mom sent. [hands her a smashed box]",25
Monica,"

Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.",13
Joey," Monica, pigeons learn

faster that you.


[Ross approaches Rachel, away from everyone else.]",13
Ross,"

Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better.

How 'bout you make a list about me.",24
Rachel,"

Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .",18
Rachel,"

OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're

gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you

know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh,

oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.",54
Ross,"

See there, you uhh, all right, ya, you did what I said.",12
Phoebe," Yeah, um, in Albany, can

I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um,

Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself

information. [hangs up]


[Phoebe's Grandmother enters]",40
Phoebe,"

Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.",10
Phoebe,"

Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.",14
Phoebe,"

No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.",12
Phoebe,"

Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! [blows a kiss

to a picture of Einstein]",21
Chandler,"

Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.",11
Joey,"

Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.",12
Chandler,"

Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll

meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, even

if Phoebe tells the one where she’s an Egyptian slave girl, we'll still

have plenty of time.


[Phoebe drives up in the cab]",45
Joey,"

Hey.


[Phoebe runs over the curb. Joey gets in the back seat, Chandler in the front]",16
Phoebe,"

Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.",14
Phoebe,"

All right, here, you have to hold this. [hands Chandler a piece of paper]",14
Phoebe,"

Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it.

[Chandler jumps out of the car]",21
Monica,"

For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.


[Rachel enters from her room]",16
Monica,"

Rach, get the heat. [Rachel holds up her hand with wet fingernail polish] Ross,

could you turn the heat down please?",21
Ross,"

Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .",13
Ross,"

Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. [goes to the radiator

and starts turning the knob] OK, this way is on, so this is. . . [breaks off

the knob] off.",34
Ross,"

No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.",14
Ross,"

Oh, oh that's right, forgot about your ability to fuse metal.",11
Monica,"

No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed.

Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme

party.",32
Phoebe,"

Ooh, this is it, 74. [screeches to a halt, Joey and Chandler are thrown into

the Plexiglas wall in the cab]",21
Phoebe,"

Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever,

huh.",17
Rachel,"

[answers door] Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your

coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.",23
Ross,"

[sitting at table talking to a girl] It's hard to tell because I'm sweating,

but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea.

How, how can that be too much? (the girl doesn’t seem to care so he gets up)",48
Monica,"

[carrying an ice cube tray] Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin.

Alright.",14
Monica,"

Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. [one of the guest opens the refrigerator] Hey,

hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next. [she opens the refrigerator and leans

into it]",29
Ross,"

Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your

earrings. Something, now, anything.",17
Ross," Alright, alright, you know

how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super,

I'm seizing. [approaches Mr. Treeger

] Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks,

merry Christmas.


[Gives him the cash.]",37
Ross,"

No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think

there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?",23
Ross," Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger , here's another 50, happy

Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?",21
Phoebe,"

OK. (Slams the door and Joey and Chandler wake up)",10
Phoebe,"

No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like,

yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and,

ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .",41
Joey,"

Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.",10
Phoebe,"

Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug

me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone

will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.",45
Phoebe,"

Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean,

what if, what if he's just still the dirt bag who ran out on my mom and us? You

know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready

to lose a real one.",56
Chandler,"

Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.",12
Joey,"

Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.",11
Chandler,"

Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!",10
Joey,"

Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?",10
Monica,"

Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.",10
Phoebe,"

Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for

now.",17
Chandler,"

Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone. [Ross and Phoebe hug,

Monica and Rachel hug, Chandler is left standing]",20
Joey,"

Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I

hope that's all right. (They all stare at him in amazement.)",26
Chandler," Ok that just leaves the gifts from Joey and Chandler.

(They get cardboard box, from a case of motor oil with presents in it, out.)
",25
Joey,"

No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.",11
Phoebe,"

Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?",15
Ross,"

Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.",15
Chandler," And last but not least.


[Chandler and Joey give Monica a pack of condoms.]",14
Joey," They're ribbed for your

pleasure.


[Ross and Monica trade their gifts.]",11
Rachel," Joey, would you slow

down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.",19
Monica," You were so amazing as

the king. I was really impressed, I was.",13
Phoebe," Although, you know what?

You might want to consider wearing underwear next time. Yeah, cause when you

sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject.",30
Ross," Come on, no one wore underwear

back then. I’m sure the critics appreciated your authenticity. (opens up his

paper)  (to Joey) Nice genitals by

the way.",26
Joey," Thanks

man! Here it is, here it is. (reading from newspaper) The only thing

worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's

disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.",29
Chandler," OK, look, that is one

guy's opinion, alright. Phoebs, read yours.",11
Phoebe," OK. (reading) The only

thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...",11
Chandler," Does anyone have one

from a different paper? Ross, read yours.",11
Joey,"  (reading) The only enjoyable moment is

when the king is beheaded and he can speak no more. ",17
Joey," Maybe they do. I've been doin'

this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's gotta be a reason.",19
Joey," No, no, no, it.. it's too

hard. It's not worth it. I quit.",13
Monica," Wait, wait, wait, wait,

wait one minute. Wait a minute. I believe this will change your mind.

(Reads from paper) In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiana was able to achieve

brilliant new levels of... continued on page 153...(turns it) sucking.",40
Rachel,"  Well, was there anything else you ever

wanted to be? ",10
Joey," I

don’t know. When I was little, I wanted to be a veterinarian, but then I

found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.",28
Ross," Yeah, yeah, just a tough

day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this

jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here,

isn't he?",36
Ross," Not at all! I love this

guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!",19
Phoebe," Oh, we were just trying

to make Joey feel better.",10
Joey," Hey no, seriously, I don't

need you to pick me... (Fun Bobby picks Joey up off the ground, bounces him.

Joey laughs.) Alright! It still works.",26
Monica," Oh, isn't he? Oh, you

know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel

so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no

boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.",48
Monica," And for our two-week

anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.",16
Rachel," We went through a lot

of wine tonight, you guys. (walks over to table, holding five empty wine

bottles)",19
Chandler," I had about a mugful in

this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.",18
Rachel," OK, so that's... that's

what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?",14
Ross," Yeah but, you know, now

that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a

drink in his hand.",25
Phoebe," Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you

know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was

soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bummed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake

up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'",43
Joey," Monica, have you ever been

with him when he wasn't drinking?",11
Monica," Well, we just happen to

go to a lot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine

tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.",38
Rachel," Yeah, we're gonna...

we're gonna get some cake. (Phoebe and Rachel go to counter.)",14
Monica," You know what? It seems

like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.",16
Monica," Look, maybe this is none of

my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about

you.",23
Phoebe," (comes back to couch,

with cake) Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?",11
Chandler," OK, I guess this is

gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.",14
Joey," Yeah, my agent just called

me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!",14
Phoebe," Oh, well, we have to

celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.",20
Chandler," Hey, yeah... we could

all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.",15
Phoebe," Hey Rach, what time do

you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.",14
Rachel," Ummmm.... well, actually

I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.",11
Rachel," Yeah... I, uhh... I have

a... I have a date.",10
Rachel,"  No with a crouton. What? What is

so strange about me having a date?",14
Joey," What about Ross? I mean,

are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?",18
Rachel," Noooo, no, I'm not mad at

him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.",15
Rachel," Oh, I know, I'm sorry you

guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating

Ross.",24
Joey," Well, I think it went

pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.",14
Joey," OK, uh.... listen, there's

something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...",16
Joey," Oh yeah, yeah, she's great,

but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I

definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent

the Little General in.",41
Monica," Oh, he's sober alright.

Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.",15
Monica," All right, here you go,

sweetie. (hands Fun Bobby his coffee)",11
Phoebe,"

Huh, so-so it’s a helpful fact as well as funny. (mouths ‘Good job!’)",13
Monica," Ahhh, hey honey? Don't

you have to be at your interview now?",12
Rachel," Maybe it was just the

kind of story where you have to be there.",14
Monica," But I'm gonna be there...

for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who

made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.",32
Phoebe," All right, don't say

that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.",17
Rachel," Hi Russ, I've just got

two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?",15
Phoebe," Well, yeah, but... no. I

mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?",15
Phoebe," (looks at Russ) Oh, yeah!

No, no, no, no, oh, oh.",11
Monica," She's just upset because

she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.",15
Chandler," (to Phoebe) Listen,

Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. (introducing Russ and Ross) Ross, Russ. Russ,

Ross.",17
Ross," Yes, yes I am. Are you a,

uh, a friend of Rachel's?",12
Chandler," You know, this is

actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.",16
Monica," See? They're as different

as night and... later that night.",10
Ross," Well, I am going to, uh...

get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.",16
Ross," Hey, I didn't know we were,

uh, seeing other people.",10
Ross," Well, uh, for your

information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other...

uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much

like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if

this is the deal...",54
Chandler," Yes, yes, but did you

see who she was dating?",10
Ross," See what? I don't know what

she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I

don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.",32
Chandler," Whoa, whoa, so I'm

guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was

hungry.",19
Joey," Yeah, if I'm willing to

sleep with the casting lady.",10
Joey," Ten years I've been waiting

for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives.

That's actually on television.",23
Joey," Well, I guess I could sleep

with her... I mean, how could I do that?",15
Chandler," Well, I... I've got a

pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.",15
Chandler," Well is she... (reaches

into the cookie jar for a cookie, takes his hand out, covered with pasta sauce)",19
Joey," Yeah, she's totally good

looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her

breakfast. (pause) You know, after having slept with her.",29
Chandler," Y'know, maybe this

isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great

job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat

guy and you've got Christmas.",44
Joey," I just... I just don't

think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it,

alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent

or because of.. y'know, the Little General.",44
Joey," Yeah, but after Denise

DeMarco, I had to promote it.",10
Monica," Yes, I would like

something. (looks at Fun Bobby, changes her mind) No, no thank you.",16
Monica," No, no really. I.. I

wouldn't feel right about it. (to waiter) Just some water.",15
Monica," (grabs waiter as he's

leaving) I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.",15
Chandler," Hey, we're having some

fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters,

atomic element number 101... ends in ium.",24
Chandler," And weenie number two

has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by

the Doody Blues.",20
Rachel," Phoebe, what the hell are

you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not

see what you're seeing.",23
Ross," (to Russ) For your

information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.",13
Chandler," OK, I'm gonna get some

more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.",13
Ross," Hey, you're a doctor of gums.

That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day

two, here's your diploma.",25
Rachel," Did Joey say what he was

gonna go when he left?",11
Chandler," No, I don't even think

he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?",18
Rachel," I don't know. Who would I

have to sleep with?",10
Monica," Bobby and I are going

away for the weekend, remember?",10
Phoebe," What's with all the bottles

of liquor? Excuse me, Miss!  In an event of a water landing, could

this seat be used as a floatation device? ",26
Monica," Oh no no, this is not for

him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about

shoelaces much more amusing.",27
Monica," What these? (holding up

liquor bottles) Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.",14
Chandler," I'll take one.

Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.",16
Joey," It was unbelievable! I

walked in there and she was all over me.",13
Joey," Well, I couldn't do it. I

told her I didn't want to get the part that way.",17
Joey," But wait, wait, wait. Then,

after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me

an even bigger part.",25
Joey," Soooooo... you are now

looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!",16
Phoebe," Oh I do, it's.... it's

Bob Saget. She hates him.",10
Ross," Ok. Here's his diaper bag,

and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!",14
Ross," Oh, great. Great. There was

a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.",15
Ross," As in, ""I now

pronounce you wife and wife"" married?",10
Ross," Why wouldn't I want to come?

I had fun at the first wedding.",13
Ross," No no no, I mean, hey, why

shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in

your joy? I'm reveling baby, believe me!",31
Ross," This is so cool. You're

actually gonna be on television.",10
Joey," It really hit me last

night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all

of u, and how these are the days of our lives..",32
Monica," (hangs up the phone) Yes!

Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's

in a full body cast.",23
Monica," They want me to do it,

which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need

the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?",31
Ross," I am really not going. I

don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?",20
Monica," They love each other, and

they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.",18
Chandler," (singing to the tune of

Mister Rogers' Neighborhood) Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the

bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.",25
Ross," Look, that has nothing to

do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd

expect me to be there.",26
Joey," Hey, if she were marrying a

guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.",14
Rachel," (entering hurriedly) Did I

miss it? Did I miss it?",10
Joey," Yeah, and she's really nice

too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart

acting.",19
Joey," It's like, you got so many

lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next

one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all

intense, you know, like this. ",42
Joey," There's my scene, there's

my scene. (on tv) ""Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's

neurosurgeon. ",17
Joey," I'm afraid the situation is

much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a (making the

smell-the-fart acting face)..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this

over coffee.",29
Chandler," For a minute there I

thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.",13
Joey," All right, all right.

""Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!""",12
Chandler," That's great. All

right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.",17
Phoebe," Um, no, huh-uh. One of my

clients died on the massage table today.",13
Chandler," That's a little more

relaxed than you want them to get.",11
Phoebe," Yeah, um, she was 82

years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.",13
Phoebe," Yeah, it's just so

strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, ""ok, I'll have some

breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my

massage."" Little did she know God was thinking, ""Ok, but that's

it."" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she

died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.",72
Monica," God, this is so hard. I

can't decide between lamb or duck.",12
Chandler," Well, of course, lambs

are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.",16
Ross," Oh, I believe I had the

half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.",14
Chandler," Yes, and this with the

cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?",12
Joey," I can't believe you're so

uptight about your mom comin'.",10
Rachel," I know, but it's just

it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't

marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?",31
Phoebe," (Mrs. Adelman's voice)

Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod

Steiger for the hundredth time. Uh, I’m sorry. At

least you guys don’t have to hear the stuff she says in my head.",41
Joey," Uh, Pheebs, how long do you

think this lady'll be with us?",12
Phoebe," I don't know. I mean, she

obviously has some kind of unfinished business. (to Chandler in Mrs. Adelman’s

voice) Sit up! (he does do)",24
Rachel," This is Joey, and Phoebe,

and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.",13
Ross," Hi, Mrs. Green. (He gets up

to shake her hand, but she ignores him.)",14
Phoebe," (in Mrs. Adelman’s voice)

I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she

got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.",30
Rachel," Yeah, well just be glad

he's not playing a smaller instrument.",11
Rachel," I know. And Mom, I

realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big

house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so

much better for me, you know?",41
Monica,"  (entering) All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian

wedding, chicken breasts.",14
Monica," Why? It's not like I'm

putting little nipples on them.",10
Rachel,"

Mom, I just don’t understand. I thought you were happy.",10
Rachel,"

Uh, but couldn’t you have listen to the radio more? ",10
Rachel,"

Mom!, Mom…mom, believe me Chandler is no reason to leave daddy! I mean….You

think this looks like I am having a lot of fun but it’s really hard, really

hard. I-I got this lousy job. I barely know if I am going to make rent, and forget

about buying stuff.",50
Rachel," No! They didn't even talk

to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?",19
Phoebe," (in Mrs. Adelman's voice)

In my day, divorce was not an option.",12
Rachel," I just can't believe this

is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting

divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.",31
Monica," Is there any chance that

you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to

be more like you.",25
Rachel," Well, then, you know,

couldn't she have just copied my haircut?",11
Chandler," You know, it's funny

when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that

all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually

kinda true.",36
Phoebe," I don't know how to say

this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck

around in me.",25
Phoebe," Yeah. Ok, you don't have

to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have

had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?",28
Rachel," No, that was his costume.

See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist. Yeah, he thought that was really funny. ",24
Monica," Um, you guys, you know

when I said before, ""thank you, but I don't really need your help""?",18
Rachel," Actually, what I think

you said was, ""don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen.""",18
Monica," Really? Weird. Anyway,

see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned.

It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.",32
Phoebe," (enters) Hey. What

a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center,

Statue of Liberty.",19
Phoebe," Yeah. I guess she hasn't

seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again.

(Takes Mrs. Green's chin in her hand and says, in Mrs. Adelman's voice)

Oh, such a pretty face.",38
Rachel, God! Did my mother just ask if we had pot?,10
Monica," All right, look, nobody's

smoking pot around all this food. ",10
Rachel," Oh, I'm sorry. You know

what? I cannot have this conversation with you.",13
Rachel,"  I mean, god, you

just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What?

What do you want? Do you want my blessing?",29
Monica," All right people, we're

in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!",19
Joey," I'm sorry, it's the pigs.

they're reluctant to get in the blankets!",12
Phoebe," Monica, how did this

happen? I thought you had this all planned out.",13
Monica," Do you want me to cry? Is

that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?",17
Ross," No. Look, I told you I am

not a part of this thing.",13
Monica," All right, look, Ross. I

realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do.

But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs,

and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called ""pigs in Ross"". All

right, ball the melon.",54
Chandler," Hey! How come I'm stuck

dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.",13
Monica," It's goin' great. Right on

schedule. Got my little happy helpers. (Everyone groans.)",13
Monica," You're still gonna pay

me, right? Or something a little less selfish.",12
Ross," I uh can't believe I'm

gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.",13
Ross," Look, do you love her? And

you don't have to be too emphatic about this.",15
Ross," Well then that's it. And if

George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my

parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look,

this is your wedding. Do it.",41
Monica," You heard the woman.

Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes",14
Joey," It just seems so futile,

you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my

powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.",31
Chandler," Well now you understand

how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.",17
Phoebe," (in Mrs. Adelman's voice)

Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.",13
Phoebe," (in Mrs. Adelman's voice)

Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! (regular voice) Whoa, she's gone. She's

gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.",26
Joey," (to Susan’s father) How's

that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? (he nods) I wrapped those bad

boys.",17
Phoebe," I know it's kind of weird,

but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel

kind of alone.",28
Chandler," (to another woman) I

shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? (The woman walks away)",17
Chandler," (to the woman who just

rejected him) All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people. (She walks away

again.)",19
Monica," Ok, which one of us do you

think is gonna be the first one to get married?",17
Joey," I got one. Which one of us

do you think will be the last to get married? (They all look at Chandler.)",22
Joey,"

Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so,

everything seems to work out OK.",21
Ross,"

I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.",11
Phoebe," I can see that, 'cause

they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.",19
Ross,"

Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.",14
Rachel,"

Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I

have a Malibu Barbie that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.",30
Ross,"

Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back

there'd be little monkey raisins in it. God, he

loved that joke.",26
Chandler," Yeah, well sure, when

he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden

I have this big “attitude problem”.",30
Joey," (enters) Hey, hey, check it out, guess

what I got.",10
Monica,"

(reading) 'Dear Dr. Ramoray, know that I love you and would do anything to have

you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed

please find 14 of my eyelashes.'",32
Monica,"

This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your

apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.",26
Chandler," Hey, y’know, you are so lucky. I have to share mine with

a bunch of guys down at work.",19
Rachel," K, Joey remember when we talked about good things-bad

things? Well this is a bad thing.


(Ross enters with a suitcase)",21
Ross,"

Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and

then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.",23
Chandler,"

You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh,

you know, isn't capable of that emotion.


(Rob (Chris Isaac) enters)",27
Phoebe,"

Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and

it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.


(Everyone laughs)",25
Chandler,"

Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves. (both laugh hysterically)


(door buzzer goes off)",17
Chandler,"

(Joey grabs a frying pan) Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We

might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.",30
Joey," Let's get out of here.


(They run out and knock on Monica and Rachel's door)",15
Joey," OK, we'll just leave, and

when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.",21
Joey,"

She's comin'.


(Both run back in their apartment. There's a knock at the door.)",14
Joey,"

Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?",11
Chandler,"

Wait, wait, wait. (Opens the top of the dish soap he's holding)


(Joey opens the door and sees Erica (Brooke Shields). Joey gets a huge smile

and Chandler squeezed the dish soap in the air.)",35
Ross,"

Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchin,

answers to the name Marcel.",22
Monica,"

I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she

like.",15
Chandler,"

Oh no no no, she's a total whack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually

Dr. Drake Ramoray..",19
Monica,"

Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not pursue this.",14
Chandler,"

Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the

magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does

she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me

for? He's the one who wants to bop the maniac.",52
Phoebe,"

No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I

picture them all in their underwear.",22
Phoebe,"

I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just,

grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids

listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?",39
Joey,"

Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10

hours, but they only showed it for 2 minutes.",23
Joey,"

Alright, just one. (she licks his hands rather emphatically) Wow, you're good

at that.


(Some guy at another table starts choking)",21
Ross,"

Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But,

um, zoo dollars?",17
Joey,"

Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh,

foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.",25
Phoebe,"

(singing) There'll be times when you get older

when you'll want to sleep with people

just to make them like you. . .

But don't.

Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody

That's another thing that you don't wanna do.",43
Phoebe,"

Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.",10
Phoebe,"

I sense these things. It was either but or butter.",10
Phoebe," Thinkin' about it. (they kiss) Ok, so if I get a library card can I take

you out sometime?",19
Ross,"

Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.",13
Ross,"

That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.",10
Ross,"

Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.",17
Ross,"

Well, there goes my whole belief system.


(knock at the door)",11
Joey,"

Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.",13
Rachel,"

Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?",10
Joey,"

All right look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, all

right. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not

Drake Ramoray, OK. I'm not even a doctor; I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a

doctor.",51
Rachel,"

Oh, I know, I know. (Turns on the TV. Joey is on it.)",13
Ross,"

That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Ramoray, Drake's evil twin.",11
Rachel,"

Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake

to, to sleep with me. (throws water in his face)",26
Monica,"

And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't. (throws water in

his face)",19
Chandler,"

And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard. (throws water in his face)",14
Joey,"

Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be

with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him,

he's the guy for you.",38
Phoebe," I

mean, what about the kids? Y’know, did you tell your board about how kids

want to hear the truth?",20
Phoebe,"

No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple

dinosaur?",18
Ross," What? What? Some weebles actually do fall down.  Huh, a stitch in time only saves seven.",16
Ross,"

Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's

right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.",27
Joey,"

I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.",12
Ross,"

This is so exciting; I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.",13
Chandler,"

What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one

joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?",21
Ross,"

Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?",10
Ross,"

Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we

used to live together.",20
Joey,"

Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey. (guard lets them in)",14
Ross,"

Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.

(Marcel grabs the elephant doll and throws it to the ground)",25
Ross,"

I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.",12
Chandler,"

(to guys wearing yellow isolation suits) So, are you guys in the movie, or are

you just really paranoid.",19
Joey,"

Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?",10
Joey,"

Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible

flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin',

is he lookin'? (Phoebe looks.)",36
Chandler,"

(to an extra in fatigues) Nice camouflage man, for a minute there I almost

didn't see ya.",17
Chandler,"

Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?",13
Chandler,"

Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.",13
Chandler,"

Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.",14
Chandler," Yes, back then I, uh,

used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.",18
Monica,"

Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie; he is so hot.",15
Monica,"

The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?",13
Rachel,"

What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst

that could happen?",19
Rachel,"

don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.",10
Rachel,"

Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks

by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.",23
Rachel,"

I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the

track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks

you're cute. So what should I tell her?",39
Chandler,"

No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was

the guy who had no elbows.",21
Chandler,"

OK that's not what he was doing. All right, he was looking for his bus money.


(a voice in the background calls for makeup)",24
Chandler,"

Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.",15
Chandler," No one was around to

hear that?


(back to Rachel and Monica)",12
Rachel,"

Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean,

naturally, you know, I said no.",23
Rachel,"

He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and

asking.",14
Monica," Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like

a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...",28
Rachel,"

And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung

out with Drew Barrymore.",18
Joey,"

Oh man, she's so smokin’, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around,

huh.",18
Monica,"

Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh actually, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll

probably end up drinking it yourself.",22
Phoebe,"

I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van

Damme.


(Ross enters)",20
Ross,"

Hey Joey I have to cancel racquetball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer.

He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.",24
Joey,"

Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.


(Chandler enters)",12
Chandler,"

Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?",10
Phoebe,"

Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.",12
Chandler,"

I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling

around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it

in an elevator?'",33
Chandler,"

Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know

what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?",30
Chandler,"

Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take

more that 2, 3 minutes tops.",25
Chandler,"

Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were

three of us in there.",19
Ross,"

OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's

favorite dish, banannacake.",18
Joey,"

Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What do you thinks gonna happen here tonight?


(phone rings)",13
Ross," Hello. Oh hi, are you on

your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work. No

it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK,

OK. OK, OK, bye. (Ross blows out the candles.)",47
Joey," 

Did we pass the moment where we

should have stopped holding hands?",12
Phoebe," All right, Monica if

there is something that you would like to share...",13
Monica,"

Y’know, you had no right to go out with him.",10
Rachel," Would you let me talk?! (flicks

Monica on the forehead)",10
Rachel," OK, well, you wouldn't

let me finish and I was jus- (Monica flicks

her back) Ow. That hurt (flicks Monica)",20
Monica,"

You flicked me first.


(They keep flicking each other. This turns into slapping each other. This leads

to wrestling on the floor. All the while Phoebe is saying ""Happy

thoughts"". Eventually Phoebe gets fed up.)",35
Phoebe,"

OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.


(Phoebe grabs each of them by an ear)",15
Phoebe,"

All right, now I will let go if you both stop.",11
Rachel,"

Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?",16
Rachel,"

You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead?

That's what you want?",20
Joey,"

So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must

have a ton of cool responsibilities.",20
Chandler,"

Because I went to an all boys’ high school and God is making up for it.",16
Chandler,"

Right now, right here? Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaace (Susie

grabs him under the table) They do have the shrimp.",25
Chandler,"

I'm going to the bathroom now. (leaves for the bathroom)",10
Ross," (to the Director’s Assistant) He likes to keep us in the

loop.


(In the bathroom Susie and Chandler are kissing. She backs into a stall.)",25
Chandler,"

Alrighty. (we see Chandler's pants drop from under the stall door)",11
Chandler,"

OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the

specials.",16
Chandler,"

Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?",14
Chandler,"

OK.


(She turns him facing the toilet and sneaks out of the stall and gathers up his

clothes.)",18
Chandler,"

Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.",11
Chandler,"

That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?",14
Monica,"

I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death,

now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? (he

nods) Can you beat up that guy?",37
Monica,"

This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed

to go on a blind date.",22
Monica," Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.",10
Rachel,"

OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.",13
Rachel," OK, you wanna play? OK,

let's play, let's play. (She grabs a jar of tomato sauce and Monica's purse)",19
Rachel,"

You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.",10
Rachel," Oh yeah. Well, at least I

wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.


(Monica pulls a thread on Rachel's sweater and Rachel dumps the tomato sauce in

Monica's purse)",34
Phoebe," Oh alright, stop, STOP

THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in

the first place?


(Monica and Rachel start yelling at the same time)",30
Phoebe,"

Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look

at yourselves.",17
Rachel,"

Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.",14
Joey,"

Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.",12
Chandler,"

Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.",10
Joey,"

Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and

someone walks off with your clothes.",21
Chandler,"

I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.",12
Chandler,"

No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.",10
Joey,"

All right, all right. (climbs up in the next stall and looks over at Chandler)

Woah, someone's flossing.


(Ross enters, sees Joey in the mirror)",25
Ross,"

(to Joey who's looking over a toilet stall) Joey, some people don't like that.",14
Ross,"

What? Let me see. (climbs up in the other adjoining stall)",11
Joey,"

Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.",12
Chandler,"

Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.


(Some guy has entered.)",15
Phoebe,"

I'm almost done with it, keep your panties on.


(Joey enters)",11
Joey,"

One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm

dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want

to go down there and say goodbye.",37
Ross,"

Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and

stuff. But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right.",31
Ross,"

Bye Marcel. See ya on the big screen. You keep people drinkin' that beer, OK. I

miss you buddy.


(Marcel is driven off in a limo)",26
Phoebe,"

You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.",13
Phoebe,"

Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can

I borrow your G-string?",19
Chandler,"

Well I never have been good to go. So uh- what the hell? Why not

try on some jewelry-uh?",19
Monica," Job? Well..uh, did I

mention that I still don't have a boyfriend?",12
Joey," Oh

yeah, well focus on this (Grabs his genital area)",10
Chandler," Hard to argue with that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times,

I promise I will never take it off my. . . [notices the bracelet

is missing from his wrist] wrist. But if, if you want to stay in

there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there. [he

starts searching the room, lifting up the couch cushions]
",68
Joey,"

Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on

his hat?",15
Joey,"

Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.",14
Joey,"

Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?",15
Joey," All right, well next time

you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you

wash.",22
Joey,"

Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a

brunch.",17
Rachel,"

Yes, but you cannot tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.",12
Phoebe,"

Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom., 'cause her name's Lily.",12
Phoebe,"

Um, a chip. I’ve got a big attitude problem.

A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.",15
Ross,"

A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? (to Rachel) Hi.",13
Rachel,"

Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?",13
Ross,"

No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for

life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know,

havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?",44
Monica,"

Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.",15
Monica,"

Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.",11
Joey,"

Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?",12
Monica,"

Yeah. It's my dad's birthday; I decided to give him a stroke.",12
Monica,"

No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling

them anything.",19
Ross," I don't know, I don't think

mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad

used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'",31
Monica," Here

we go. Here we go. Here we go. OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. ",14
Monica," No. You

know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya

know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.",29
Ross,"

Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him; they still wouldn't believe

it. (opens door) We're here.",17
Monica,"

Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.",11
Joey,"

Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So

when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.",27
Joey,"

Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?",10
Phoebe,"

I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a

more open, giving spirit. (sees something else) Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.",28
Phoebe,"

What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?",11
Phoebe,"

I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals

boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?",21
Phoebe,"

Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a

lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible.

Do you want to get this tattoo?",40
Rachel,"

Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .",10
Phoebe,"

OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?",10
Phoebe," No. You are the boss of

you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your

hip. GO!! (to a man seating in a chair) I

haven’t even got my tattoo yet and I’m already tougher.",41
Monica,"

God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.",16
Joey,"

Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.",12
Joey,"

Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I

love.",15
Joey,"

All right, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.",10
Joey,"

I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place

where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.",28
Joey,"

What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to

live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.",24
Monica,"

You remember that video I found of mom and dad?",10
Ross,"

Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and

some of them aren't. (looks at her glass) Is that crystal?",27
Monica,"

No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's

sweet, and know you'd like him. (she puts her arm around Richard)",28
Monica,"

Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .",14
Monica,"

Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.",12
Monica,"

Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself,

you've never seen Richard happier.",21
Rachel,"

I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, let me se

yours.",20
Phoebe,"

Oh OK. (pulls over her shirt and shows a bare shoulder) Oh no, oh it's gone,

that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.",25
Rachel,"

Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.",13
Phoebe,"

I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and

uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?",29
Rachel," Really? You don't say,

because mine was licked on by kittens.",11
Rachel," No. It’s just like a pinch; like that. (pinches Phoebe

on her arm)",13
Joey,"

These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.",14
Joey,"

Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to

the environment.",17
Joey,"

Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never

lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me

to grow or. . . whatever.",39
Joey,"

Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.",17
Joey,"

All right, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.",17
Phoebe,"

OK, well then what is this? (shows her bare shoulder)",10
Rachel,"

That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair,

barely touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.",31
Phoebe,"

OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of

the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from

heaven.",33
Rachel,"

Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going,

'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo; this

is a tattoo. (she bends over and bears her tattoo right when Ross returns)",47
Rachel,"

Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.",11
Ross,"

Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.",17
Ross,"

Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?",11
Joey,"

Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?",10
Phoebe,"

I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.",12
Monica,"

I know, how can you not be across the hall anymore?",11
Rachel,"

Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that

my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?",27
Joey,"

Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know,

fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids

couldn't even get theirs across the street.",36
Ross," Hey, let's bring the rest

of these down to the truck.


(Everyone except Joey and Chandler leave.)",17
Joey,"

Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.",11
Monica," I

do. Dad, you’re wearing the tie that I got you! ",11
Joey,"

Huh? So what do you think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.",14
Monica,"

(looking at some kind of glass sculpture thing) Wow Joey, this is, uhh...",13
Ross,"

(looking at a glass table with a panther shaped base) Look, check this out. Is

it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.",28
Rachel,"

(holding a pillow made out of 4 inch red fur) Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me,

is this genuine Muppet skin?",22
Phoebe,"

(looking at a water sculpture that looks like a window with rain running down

it) Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing. ",20
Joey,"

Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee.",14
Phoebe,"

Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.",10
Ross,"

Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing.",13
Phoebe,"

So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?",11
Joey,"

Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. (leads them to the bathroom, gestures

towards toilet, everyone stares, uncomprehending) Heh?",20
Rachel,"

(to Monica) OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie,

someone just got the last piece.


(Phoebe enters)",24
Phoebe,"

Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I

have just been discovered.",23
Chandler,"

Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.",15
Phoebe,"

Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is

until I'm done, OK.",19
Phoebe,"

OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that

I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.",32
Phoebe,"

I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video.",15
Phoebe,"

I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an

album.


(Everyone is quiet, unsure if she's done or not)",28
Rachel,"

Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the

man's hood.",21
Rachel,"

Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.


(Ross goes over behind the guy and grabs the pie out of his hood as he leaves)",26
Ross,"

Calm down, I'm blow drying.


(Rachel enters with laundry and starts folding)",12
Monica,"

Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like

I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake

up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all

over again .",52
Monica,"

I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.",10
Ross,"

(in a childish voice) I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.",14
Joey," Oh.  He said

he might stop up after his shift. ",10
Chandler,"

So, what do you say boys, should I call him? (squeezes the ear of one of the

slippers and it barks) Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a

question... you're going crazy.",35
Chandler,"

Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.",11
Joey,"

Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'",12
Chandler,"

Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.",12
Joey,"

Well OK then. (oven timer goes off behind Chandler) Was that the oven timer?",14
Joey,"

Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Bleeth.",12
Chandler,"

Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Bleeth?",11
Joey,"

I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my

thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd

think.",32
Phoebe,"

Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?",10
Joey,"

You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night

but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.",25
Chandler,"

But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it

was like when we first started living together.",26
Ross,"

Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his

new place, all right. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.",27
Rachel,"

Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.",11
Phoebe,"

OK. (singing) Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly

cat (back up singers start singing smelly, smelly, smelly, smelly

behind her) Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?",35
Phoebe,"

OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an

aquarium, ya know. Wow there so good! (waves to the

singers) Hi, you are so good!",32
Phoebe,"

OK. (singing) Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly

cat (back up singers - smelly, smelly, smelly, really bad smelly cat,

it's not your fault) OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that

everyone um, gets how smelly this cat actually is. I just think that maybe if

we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the

cat.",69
Ross,"

No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge,

OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah,

yeah. (Monica comes out of her room) Oh, were you takin' a nap?",42
Ross,"

Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. (gets the other

line) Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. (hangs

up the other line) Call Joanna. (back on with Tony) Hi.",43
Ross,"

Wait hold on Tony, hold on. (answers second line) Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's

right here. Um hold on. (gets first line) Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's

uh, that's my sister's boyfriend.",35
Ross,"

OK. (gets off the phone and gives it to Monica)",10
Joey,"

You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's

with the boxes?",16
Chandler,"

Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.",15
Joey,"

Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. (grabs moose hat) It's what I came for. So, this

is new. Where'd you two meet?",21
Chandler,"

Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a

spare room.",21
Chandler,"

Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.",14
Joey,"

Well I uh, got what I came for. (puts on moose hat) I'll uh, I'll see you guys.",18
Chandler,"

Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?",10
Monica,"

I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?",12
Rachel,"

It'll never last; he's just a rebound roommate.


(Phoebe enters)",10
Phoebe,"

Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video.",13
Phoebe,"

Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of

you ever made a video. (puts the tape in) OK.


(The video begins.)",31
Phoebe," I, I, I've never heard myself

sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear

what you hear.",27
Joey,"

Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. (looks for the mail on the

table by the door, it's not there) Where's the mail?",27
Joey,"

You don't keep it over here on this table any more?",11
Joey,"

No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the

middle, a-la me.",20
Chandler,"

Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn

good.",16
Joey,"

Great, well, I'm happy for ya. (picks up the orange juice carton and it's empty)

All right that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Johnny Neweggs, with his, his,

his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice.

There's no juice for the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need

the juice.",63
Joey,"

Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?",11
Joey,"

Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one

better than the other and I wanna know which.",23
Chandler,"

Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took

your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?",27
Joey," Well maybe this isn’t about the eggs.  Maybe this is about the chicken that

laid ‘em! Hmm?",17
Ross,"

Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengeti. (changes channel)",10
Monica,"

Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me?",10
Rachel,"

Now I'm mommy in this little play? All right look, I refuse to get sucked into

this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a

nice long hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy. (goes in the

bathroom)",47
Monica,"

Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin-

you been here.",18
Ross,"

Ow, ow, OK. All right, all right, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, all

right.",15
Monica,"

I just can't stand you being here all the time.",10
Ross,"

Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know,

we're just havin' fun.",20
Ross,"

Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around.

Like when, uh, when we were kids.",21
Monica,"

Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to'

kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.",29
Monica,"

Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got

your way.",18
Monica,"

Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.",11
Monica,"

Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.",10
Monica,"

If you really want to watch that Serengeti thing, you can.",11
Phoebe,"

Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.",17
Phoebe,"

Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign,

saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.",31
Phoebe,"

Well, I can't work with people who would do this.",10
Phoebe,"

The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a

video.",18
Chandler,"

(stares in disbelief) Yeah o-, OK, all right. (oven timer goes off) Doesn't

matter, time for Baywatch.",17
Chandler,"

Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.",12
Chandler,"

Oh o-, OK man.


(Joey's place. He's watching Baywatch, laughing. He goes to say something to

Chandler in the other chair but no one's there. He goes to call Chandler but

decides not to.)


(Chandler's. He's playing foosball by himself.)


(Joey's. Playing ping pong by himself.)


(All by myself is playing. Chandler is sitting in front of a window

while it's raining outside. We see Joey through a rainy window. The camera

zooms out to show it's just his tabletop water sculpture.)",82
Phoebe," Umm, I’m gonna

start off with a little song called Smelly Cat. Yay. Oh, for those of

you who are wondering this is my real voice. (singing) Smelly cat,

smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.",37
Phoebe," Uh, Ross, those are the

only lines we have, sorry. Back to the chorus

everybody! ",15
Rachel, ‘Cause she just found out she was cut out of the will.,12
Phoebe," Ugh, doesn’t she know you can’t define yourself in terms

of money? That it’s about values and morals, and your ability to give and

receive love. ",26
Joey,"

Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and

I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I

find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.",39
Phoebe,"

No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel

bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.",25
Chandler,"

Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break

out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.",27
Chandler,"

Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.",10
Phoebe,"

Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?",12
Chandler,"

No he's, he's all right, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.",16
Phoebe,"

Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's

remedy that, shall we?",18
Phoebe,"

Oh yeah, it'll be fun. (throws a tennis ball at Eddie's bedroom door)",13
Phoebe,"

Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers

and got to know each other.",24
Phoebe,"

Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and

Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train.

Have fun bye.",36
Chandler,"

So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets or..?


[Time lapse. Chandler and Eddie are talking.]",22
Chandler,"

What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn

was the capital of Cambodia.",19
Phoebe,"
And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played

maracas. That's it, thanks, good night.",24
Monica,"

Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I

thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.",24
Phoebe,"

Oh, this is so nice. All right I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that

of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the

best.",37
Chandler,"

Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or

a fish tank?",20
Chandler,"

Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my

very soul.",18
Chandler,"

Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...",10
Chandler,"

Bit country? Or uh, you know a little bit rock and

roll? C'mon in here you roomy.",17
Joey,"

Pheebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.",13
Phoebe,"

Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.",12
Phoebe,"

Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.'

Ooh, cool picture.",19
Phoebe,"

Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?",13
Joey,"

Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident?

Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital,

she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital,

she's not gonna live.'",51
Phoebe," Ohh, ok, I see what you

did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad

when they read this?",24
Joey,"

I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an

elevator shaft?",18
Monica,"

Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there

actually are, it's a very small percentage.",22
Rachel,"

Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.",11
Monica,"

All right, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've

been with?",18
Monica,"

Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?",12
Monica,"

Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth. (goes in the bathroom)",17
Monica,"

Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.


(Rachel's bedroom)",10
Rachel,"

Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.",10
Ross,"

Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?",10
Ross,"

C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.",11
Rachel,"

Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.",11
Rachel,"

Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you

than I ever was with him.",21
Chandler,"

This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a

fish tank, and left, end of story.",23
Monica,"

And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're

doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?",27
Monica,"

Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.",10
Rachel,"

Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo

ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.",30
Ross,"

Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over

and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell

knock-knock jokes.",35
Rachel,"

God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had

was...",17
Ross,"

Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like,

there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a

little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?",39
Rachel,"

Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good

with Paolo.",21
Rachel,"

But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have

intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.",31
Ross,"

Until now. (jumps on Rachel on the bed)


(later in the bathroom Monica is looking in the drawer, Rachel runs up)",21
Rachel,"

Ooooh yeah.


(they pull out the box of condoms but there's only one left)",14
Monica,"

Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something. (shuts the

bathroom door)",16
Ross,"

(comes out of the bedroom) Rachel. (growls then sees Richard standing there)

Hey.",13
Ross,"

Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?",14
Ross,"

Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?",11
Rachel,"

Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.",10
Rachel,"

Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.",17
Monica,"

All right, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where

we keep the dustpan.",22
Rachel,"
Ok you know what, you know what? We are both adults

here. Right? There’s got to be a mature way to handle this. Rock-paper-scissors?",24
Ross,"

No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voight

was...",16
Monica,"

It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.",13
Chandler,"

So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.",16
Chandler,"

Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.",12
Chandler,"

Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the

fish.",14
Rachel,"

Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please? (they turn

on the TV)",17
Chandler,"

Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.",10
Monica,"

And some of us really have to pee.


(Joey opens the door)",12
Joey,"

I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.",13
Rachel,"

Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.",11
Joey,"

Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the

only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony

or somethin’.",35
Phoebe,"

But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb

soap opera.",18
Joey,"

Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.",11
Phoebe,"

Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have

something nice to say.",17
Monica,"

Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me

that's nice.",17
Joey,"

No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you

think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would

be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got

this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been

pre-approved for anything in my life.",68
Rachel,"

Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll

always be pre-approved with us.",19
Chandler,"

(throws it across the room while Eddie's not looking) Listen Eddie, um, I've

been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?",26
Chandler,"

(looks in the fish bowl to see a fish cracker,

gives Eddie a confused look) Well that's not an, even a real fish. No,

that's a goldfish cracker.",28
Chandler,"

Ok, good night. (walks towards his room) You big freak of nature.",12
Chandler,"

No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment

now.",18
Rachel,"

Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?",12
Joey,"

Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at

'em and I though, you know what I don't have?",26
Monica,"

Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.",15
Joey,"

Hey, I'll be all right. I mean it's not like I'm starting from square one. I

was Dr. Drake Ramoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta

have some kind of cache.",35
Joey,"

Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.",14
Monica,"

Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's

about how women need to become more empowered.",22
Phoebe,"

Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses.

But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.",27
Phoebe,"

Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.",10
Monica,"

It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've

ever had, except for Richard.",18
Phoebe,"

Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool

of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.",26
Phoebe,"

Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um,

'Hello, who wants one of my phallic shaped man cakes?'",22
Joey,"

So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?",11
Joey,"

But I was Dr. Drake Ramoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin'

a cab?",18
Joey,"

But this is a two-line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna

do this.",17
Rachel,"

Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have

been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.",24
Phoebe,"

I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice

gift for you.",20
Rachel,"

No, why do we always have to do everything according to your timetable?",13
Ross,"

Actually it's the movie theatre that has the timetable. So you don't miss the

beginning.",15
Rachel,"

No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.",15
Monica,"

You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?",10
Rachel,"

Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?",16
Ross,"

You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.",13
Rachel,"

Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.",15
Ross,"

I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some

kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's

pretty upset about it.",36
Joey,"

See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.",11
Joey,"

It's my VISA bill. ‘Envelope one of two.’ That can't be good.",12
Joey,"

Look at this, how did I spend so much money?",10
Ross,"

Uh Joey, that's just the minimum amount due, that's your total due.",12
Joey,"

My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all

confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.",25
Ross,"

Well I guess you can start by drivin’ a cab on Another World.",13
Ross,"

So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.",10
Joey,"

Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgmental and condescending and

pedantic.",13
Ross,"

Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.",13
Joey,"

Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.",10
Joey,"

Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,'

and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'",24
Ross,"

But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it

Chromantic.",18
Ross,"

Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that

job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.",29
Ross,"

Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.",10
Chandler,"

Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there

something else you're supposed to be doing right now?",23
Chandler,"

Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the

time...",19
Joey,"

Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my

character on the show.",19
Chandler,"

Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no

more watching.",16
Chandler,"

Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.",14
Chandler,"

You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!",13
Chandler,"

This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.",17
Joey,"
All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna

cost you about so bucks.",20
Joey,"

Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was

on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Ramoray, they'd send over the whole

script on real paper and everything. ",36
Joey,"

And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have

the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a

background in medical acting.",35
Rachel,"  No okay

honey, I know you didn’t mean to. (listens)  I know me too. ",14
Monica," Rach, hang up! You’re supposed to be taking a Goddess

quiz.  You know, you should lose

like 100 points just for calling your boyfriend in the middle of it. ",29
Rachel," (on the phone) Bye bye. (hangs up) God. (walks over to

the couch)",13
Phoebe,"

Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lightning bearer to take your

wind? I would have to say no.",21
Rachel,"

Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.",16
Phoebe,"

Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous

truth on the first date.",21
Rachel,"

Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever

betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.",25
Monica,"

Huuh, all right, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle

was totally pointing at me.",19
Phoebe,"

Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess

meetings alone.",18
Rachel,"

Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke

up with Monica.",19
Joey,"

Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.",15
Joey,"

They're takin’ all my stuff back. I guess you were right.",11
Ross,"

No look I wasn’t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung

up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing,

ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you

don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.",63
Ross,"

Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much

respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.",28
Ross,"

(approaching the mover holding the parrot) Hey hold on, hold on. How much for

the uh, how much to save the bird?",22
Ross,"

Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?",15
Rachel,"

No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have

enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.",30
Phoebe,"

I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.",13
Rachel,"

Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my

paycheck.",16
Chandler,"

Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window

holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!",30
Monica,"

So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?",11
Chandler,"

Well, I'm, I'm sorry...(Eddie forces his head in the door) Ahhh. Have we met?",14
Chandler,"

I, I'm sorry, I uh (unchains the door and opens it all the way) I already have

a roommate. (Joey turns around in the leather recliner)",26
Chandler,"

Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking

about man.",16
Chandler,"

See ya. (shuts the door) Goodbye you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to

help you unpack your stuff?",20
Joey,"

Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I

have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I

mean, this is...",38
Chandler,"

Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?",15
Chandler,"

I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so

much, why did you buy it in the first place?",26
Joey,"

Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the

other ones, it just looks tacky.",21
Chandler," Yeah with things like this more is always better. So is he

housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay.

Good, STAY! Good fake dog.",31
Phoebe,"

Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie.",13
Phoebe,"

What when Yeller saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?",12
Phoebe,"

Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.",14
Phoebe,"

He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.",12
Phoebe,"

What, what's about to happen? (starts watching) I've never seen this part

before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down

the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end,

THE END. (hear the gunshot from the TV) Ok what kind of sick snuffy dog

film is this?!",63
Monica,"

Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got

leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but

rubber gloves.


(Chandler and Joey come sprinting in)",33
Joey,"

Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna

come over.",17
Monica,"
Oooh, that teach me a lesson. All right,

I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.",17
Monica,"

All right, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the

gym, and no I don't look.",21
Joey,"

No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game

tonight, we have an extra ticket.",22
Chandler,"

Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues

and Dan with the poking. (starts poking Monica in the shoulder) 'Did you see

that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'",41
Monica,"

Ok. (Richard walks in) Hey, why don't you ask Richard?",10
Joey,"

Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had

to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you

pick?",33
Monica,"

I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?",11
Monica,"

C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.",11
Chandler,"

I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't

know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old (Monica gives him a

glare) -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.",41
Monica,"

So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if

you ask him, he might take you on his Jag. (walks off)",29
Joey,"

How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in

the cool car?",22
Joey,"

(Monica walks back in the kitchen) Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but

only if he takes the Jaguar.",21
Ross,"

Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and

he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys

missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.",45
Ross,"

I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed,

what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I

miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquor?",45
Ross,"

Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a

day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-",34
Ross,"

Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speech prepared.",10
Monica,"

Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and

you've got yourself a part-ay.",18
Phoebe,"

Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told

me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the

pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.


(Chandler and Joey enter)",46
Monica,"

Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?",10
Joey,"

Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the

matter with you, he's parking the car.",22
Chandler,"

Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.",14
Joey,"

Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our

seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. (With money in his palm)

Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats (shakes his had and passes the

dollar).",49
Chandler,"

You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car (passes the dollar back).",13
Monica,"

So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?",12
Ross,"

Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.",12
Monica,"

Look. (they look at Joey in the kitchen with a cigar in his mouth, looking at

his reflection in a spatula) Joey, do you know we can see you from here?",31
Joey,"

How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?",13
Ross,"

Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.",13
Monica,"

You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.",14
Joey,"

Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.


(Chandler enters with his hair full of mousse and a cheesy moustache)",20
Joey,"

Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both

grew it, we'd look like dorks.",23
Chandler,"

Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.",12
Monica,"

Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you

were the guys.",20
Monica,"

With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?",10
Ross,"

Hi, we're visiting. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm

gonna tell your mommies you said it anyway so you might as well try.",29
Ross,"

Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn

into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a

sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.",40
Rachel,"

Oh, yeah sure, Ok. (she takes Ben and holds him at arms length)",13
Rachel,"

Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around

them, I mean, you know, since I was one.",25
Ross,"

Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.",12
Ross,"

Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two

babies.",15
Ross,"

Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here

won't feel too competitive.",21
Ross,"

Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh,

Scarsdale.",16
Ross,"

Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents

that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come

over and baby-sit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little

higher than, let's say, Nassau County but the school system's supposedly great.",59
Rachel,"

Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.",10
Phoebe,"

Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.",12
Phoebe,"

Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and

and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.",22
Phoebe,"

With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like

ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.",25
Monica,"

So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfulness is baked right in.",14
Phoebe,"

Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought

I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou

Gehrig's disease.",32
Phoebe,"

Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will restore all your faith in humanity.",14
Chandler,"

Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of

steel.",17
Monica,"

Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with

them for me, I mean, they have each other.",24
Monica,"

Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those

people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.",31
Monica,"

It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know,

what do I do?",20
Phoebe,"

Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to

blow your pets head off.",19
Monica,"

I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.",11
Rachel,"

Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.",10
Monica,"

Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's

something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an

at home bikini wax with leftover Christmas candles.",40
Rachel,"

I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next

thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the

taxes.",31
Ross,"

Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're

assembling bones, your mind wanders.",20
Rachel,"

Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating

for six weeks.",18
Rachel,"

Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night

and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think

about what our children’s names are gonna be. You know what our children’s

names are gonna be.",45
Ross,"

No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and

I thought, I thought that might be good.",27
Rachel,"

Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.",10
Rachel,"

But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like

that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like

not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be

with me you are gonna have to deal with that.",62
Ross,"

Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna

stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up

together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with

that.",44
Phoebe,"

Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey

destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean

pharmacist made his ear bleed.",33
Monica,"

All right, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was

pretty wonderful?",17
Chandler,"

Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.",11
Monica,"

(enters) Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the

table.",14
Monica,"

(grabs the other two bars on Richard's side and scores) Score! Now can we go?",15
Chandler,"

Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hogging

so much of his time.",21
Joey,"

No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler

than our dads. (Chandler starts kicking him below the table) I mean, you know,

our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just-(Chandler kicks him) ow, ow.

What are you kickin’ me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.",56
Chandler,"

Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular.

See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.",23
Chandler,"

No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down

at work.",17
Chandler,"

I can't believe you got us into trouble. (slaps Joey on the arm. Joey takes

exception and slaps him back. Chandler slaps him

back then Joey slaps him twice on the arm and runs into his bedroom while

Chandler chases him.)",41
Monica,"

(her and Richard return to her place) So are you ok?",11
Monica,"

Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool

guy, you suck at foosball.",22
Ross,"

Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper

pail.",17
Rachel,"

Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process

any cuter.",17
Ross,"

Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together. (walks in his room)",16
Rachel,"

Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. (finishes the

diaper) There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.",34
Rachel,"

I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross,

Ben just said 'Hi'.",21
Ross,"

Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.",10
Rachel,"

Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.",12
Ross,"

Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, what do you say?

Ok. All right so I've got him.",23
Rachel,"

Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said,

you said bye to me. You said bye to me.",28
Monica,"

'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my

initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three

hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.",47
Ross,"

Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an

interview.",15
Phoebe,"

Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.",11
Ross,"

On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.",10
Phoebe,"

No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs

telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed

a buffet...which is my father's last name.",39
Phoebe,"

And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end.

And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.",24
Phoebe,"

No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean

coincidences? I don't think so.",22
Phoebe,"

Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.",11
Phoebe,"

Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.",12
Chandler,"

And E-I-E-I-O is what your mom said when your dad left her.",12
Chandler,"

Hey, you just wanna forget about racquetball and hang out here?",11
Chandler,"

Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?",12
Ross,"

Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.

(As they're walking off, little bully grabs Chandlers hat 

from behind and puts it on himself)",24
Ross,"

Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But,

come on guy just, just give him back the hat.",26
Ross,"
Because it's a special hat. (Chandler looks at Ross funny) See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to

cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...",35
Chandler,"

Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually

stealing my hat?",16
Joey," I'm telling 

you Rach. I have gone Dad hunting with Phoebe before. This is a very scary thing 

for her. She gets real vulnerable and..that's why we're there to...be supportive 

and crap.",32
Rachel," Ok. 

Well, you just let me know when to do which. ",11
Monica,"

It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on

the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I

mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and

Curly Fries?",49
Monica,"

How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.",12
Chandler,"

The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.",10
Ross,"

It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya

know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to

happen anymore.",25
Chandler,"

Ohhh (turns as if to hug someone) Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.",16
Joey,"

Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.",11
Chandler,"

Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.",12
Monica,"

My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had

invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that

today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.",39
Rachel,"

Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the

stock market.",16
Joey,"

See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?",12
Phoebe,"

Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi

birthfather'.",17
Phoebe," 

(a little dog starts attacking her leg) Hey, hey, no, oh oh.",12
Phoebe,"

No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.",15
Joey,"

Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?",10
Phoebe,"

Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece

of crap. (Flings the dog off and jumps in the cab. The dog keeps jumping up to

the window.) Ok, alright, we have a problem.",40
Joey,"

Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.",11
Rachel,"

Ok, here, I know what we can do. (grabs Joey's sandwich and throws it out the 

window)",17
Rachel,"

Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie.

(dog ignores the sandwich) Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey,

the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that

say?",42
Chandler,"

Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really

cool jackets?",18
Ross,"

You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.",10
Chandler,"

Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call

the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.",24
Ross,"

Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are

trying to take our seat.",18
Ross,"

Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.",13
Ross," 

Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice. (flicks the ends of the big 

bully's tie)",18
Ross,"

Yeah.


(The bullies grab the back of the couch that Ross and Chandler are sitting in 

and tip back)",19
Ross,"

Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.",14
Phoebe,"

I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast

at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I

mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be

around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely

spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and

I just, I want things to be like just right.",89
Phoebe,"

Ok, thanks. Sorry, again


(She starts the cab and pulls forward. We hear a squish and a dog yelp.)",19
Monica,"

I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon

time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.",22
Joey,"

Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down

there and kick your wall street butt.'",22
Monica,"

Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?",10
Joey,"

Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.",11
Monica,"

Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money

and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.",18
Monica,"

Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I

think it sounds zexy.",20
Monica,"

MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they

go down.",20
Phoebe,"

Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the

little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.",28
Phoebe,"

Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in

a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.",29
Rachel,"

Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is

ok?",19
Phoebe,"

I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I

gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I

broke your dog.'",31
Phoebe,"

Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok. (goes over and grabs the phone 

that's sitting by Monica)",19
Rachel,"

She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.",10
Joey," 

(in a deep fake voice) Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want 

you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 

24 hours. Uh, goodbye. (hangs up)",39
Ross,"

Thank you.


(They both pour in packets of cappuccino mix.)",10
Chandler,"

Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.",12
Ross,"

Absolutely.


(They both stir their coffee and proceed to stare into the mugs)",13
Chandler,"Well

the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink,

stir and drink, never let it settle.


(They both try to drink while continuously stirring)",30
Joey," 

(walks out of his room) Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I

get back from my niece's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you

and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.",44
Ross,"

No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup

of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking

cappuccino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those

guys.",51
Joey,"

Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?",10
Ross,"

No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man

has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or

somethin'.",35
Chandler,"

Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think

actually mine's growing back.",17
Monica," 

(Opens the door) I need to borrow a hundred bucks.",10
Monica,"

Hi, welcome home. (pulls Rachel inside) I need to borrow a hundred bucks.",13
Monica,"

I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.",11
Monica,"

Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.",11
Monica,"

Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?",10
Monica,"

But I need it. Other words I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You

know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame

retardant boobs.",32
Phoebe,"

It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog

on purpose. She's a vegetarian.",22
Phoebe,"

Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you

can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.",31
Phoebe,"

Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?",11
Phoebe,"

Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.


(She turns to leave, Frank follows)",19
Phoebe,"

Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.",12
Phoebe,"

Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?",10
Phoebe,"

I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named

Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'",31
Ross,"

Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of

coffee take?",19
Chandler,"

Would you come on! Come on! (waitress brings their coffee) Thank you.


(They rush to put the cream and sugar in their cups and gulp down a few drinks)",29
Ross,"

Cannot feel my tongue.


(They leave. As they're walking out, the bullies are walking in.)",15
Chandler,"

Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?",15
Chandler,"

Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage

with it.",17
Ross,"

Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.",13
Chandler,"

Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the

middle?",16
Ross,"

Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm

standin here, huh.",20
Chandler,"

Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff! (Some guy runs off with the hat)",15
Ross,"

God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked

butt.",15
Ross,"

So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?",10
Chandler,"

Huh. (reaches over and grabs the hat and bolts for the door but slips and falls 

behind the couch)",19
Chandler,"

Guys guys, check this out.


(Chandler puts a coin in the mini jukebox at the table. YMCA starts playing and

Monica and the rest of the staff have to get on the counter and start singing

along and dancing. After a couple of courses, Chandler pulls out a handful of 

coins and drops them on the table.)",57
Monica,"

So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday,

I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.",28
Ross,"

Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?",13
Ross,"

Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?",12
Joey,"

Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?",15
Phoebe,"

Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on

the inside and I'm just not sure we are.",25
Monica,"

Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind

of party you want.


(Joey is staring at Monica's breasts)",26
Monica,"

Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok,

they're fake. See (squeezes her breast) honk honk.",22
Ross,"

I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.",10
Monica,"

Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.",14
Chandler,"

Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called

her back.",17
Joey,"

Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just

got scared.",18
Chandler,"

Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.",11
Rachel,"

Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's

graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to

what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.",37
Rachel,"

My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile

proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight

in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and

shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve

coffee for the next 8 hours.",67
Phoebe,"

Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?",10
Monica,"

Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.",10
Joey,"

Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.


(Knock at the door)",13
Monica," 

(answers the door) Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing

here?",15
Monica,"

No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that

she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.",29
Monica,"

No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um,

this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.",22
Chandler,"

This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?


(Knock at the door, Monica answers to see Mrs. Greene)",19
Joey,"

Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on

Rachel's bed.",17
Monica,"

Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for

you yet.",18
Phoebe," 

(cutting Mrs. Greene off) Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the

rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come

with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a

restaurant Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon. (They go in the bathroom)",57
Joey," 

(peeks back out) Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, (sees that the

coast is clear) oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.",30
Monica,"

So uh, Joey and Chandler, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to

your place.",19
Monica,"

Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.",15
Chandler,"

Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.",10
Chandler,"

Alright you guys are off to party number one (ushers 3 guys into Monica's

apartment) and you, you are off to party number two [ushers four women into his

apartment. Two guys try to follow and Chandler blocks them and shoos them off

to Monica's apartment) Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.",56
Monica,"

Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? (buzzer goes off)

Alright that's Ross.",17
Chandler,"

Ok, they're coming, shhh. (Runs into Monica's apartment and grabs one last girl 

to take to his apartment)",18
Rachel,"

Ohh, thank you for my beautiful earrings, they're perfect. I love you.",12
Ross,"

Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.",10
Rachel,"

Now I love you even more.


(They kiss and Ross backs her into her apartment and turns on the lights)",20
Rachel,"

Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.",13
Monica,"

Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.",13
Rachel,"

Daddy.


[Time lapse. Still at party at Chandler and Joey's. Rachel is

talking to Chandler and Ross.]",17
Rachel,"

Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?",13
Ross,"

You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your

party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who

cares.",32
Rachel,"

Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could

look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.",31
Chandler,"

It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the

food committee.


[Time lapse. Chandler runs out of the bathroom.]",22
Chandler,"

Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,'

and stuck her tongue down my throat. I love this party.",27
Joey,"

Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey

lamp, did you?",19
Rachel,"

Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.",16
Rachel,"

Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you

should be ok.


[Back in Monica's party]",22
Monica,"

Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down

your most embarrassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the

markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.


[Back in Chandler and Joey's party]",51
Ross,"

Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?",12
Ross,"

I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my

table are already dead.


[Back in Monica's party]",23
Monica,"

Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed

that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you

hear them click. (She demonstrates, Gunther starts to walk to the door) Gunther, where're you going?",48
Monica,"

No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here,

here's your marker.",19
Phoebe,"

Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the

door and don't look back.


[Back at Chandler and Joey's party]",27
Ross,"

Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?",10
Ross,"

Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a

glass.",17
Ross,"

Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.",14
Ross," Oh, mine too. Isn't that

neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? (walks out in the hallway,

Mr. Green is walking out of Chandler and Joey's apartment) Hey, hey, where you

uh, sneaking off to mister?",36
Ross,"

No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there,

it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch

back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.",44
Ross,"

All righty roo. (closes the door) What a great moment to say that for the first

time. (goes to get the cigarettes and glasses)",24
Monica,"

Ok, the first person's most embarrassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.'

Very funny.",14
Phoebe,"

Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?",11
Monica,"

What? (she runs over to where Phoebe is, Phoebe signals for Gunther to go) I

don't see anything.",18
Ross,"

Um-hmm. (puts them on) I have a condition, apparently, that I require two

different sets of focals.",17
Ross," Ohh, big smoker. (Packs the

cigarettes and flings one on Mrs. Greene in the process. Finally gets one in

his mouth and it look really out of place) Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go

out into the hallway and fire up this bad boy. (As he walks into the hall, he

comes face to face with Mr. Green)",60
Ross," Yes. (pulls them off and

hands them to Mr. Green) I was

just warming up the earpieces for you.",19
Ross," (pulls the cigarette off

his upper lip and hands it to Mr. Green)

Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.


[Back in Monica's party. Phoebe is talking to a guy and two girls at the

party.]",39
Phoebe,"

Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to

be now, she'll be back any minute.",26
Phoebe,"

No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.",14
Phoebe,"

There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next

door.",14
Phoebe,"

Everything you've heard is true.


[Back at Chandler and Joey's party. Everyone is dancing and having fun.]",17
Monica,"

Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.",16
Chandler," Joey, if 

these people found out they were playing spelling games over there,  there 

will be nothing left at our party. 


(Chandler and Joey stop dancing and laugh at her)",30
Monica,"

You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you

doing here?",17
Phoebe," 

(enters with the three people she got out) Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.",13
Phoebe,"

Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's

Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.",24
Monica,"

Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious

sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance... (volleyball 

hits her in the head from behind)


[Back at Monica's party]",40
Rachel,"

Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what,

right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.


[Chandler and Joey's party]",30
Rachel,"

Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do,

but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.


[Monica's party]",29
Chandler," 

(running out of his apartment after a girl) Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll

be skins. I'll be skins. (sits down beside Rachel) Hey, how you holdin' up

there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of

tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.",58
Rachel,"

This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom

there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some

condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get

through this?",46
Chandler,"

Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the

bed.",15
Rachel,"

Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch

about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.",31
Chandler," 

Because it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?",15
Rachel,"

It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the

fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My

sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset

because nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for

doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you

know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this

one blanket. It never occurred to anybody to bring another one. And now it's

just...",108
Monica,"

Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.",10
Monica,"

Ok, let me go check. Your mom wants to say goodbye.",11
Rachel," Ok.


(Mr. Green opens the door to 

Chandler and Joeys apartment. Ross sees him and runs to the door forcing him 

back in then holds onto the door knob.)",29
Ross," I'm getting ready for the 

water skiing. (Mr. Green opens the door which pulls Ross in) How are you doing?",20
Phoebe,"

Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should,

it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. (opens the door, the guys

are right there) Or perhaps you'd like a crème d'menthe.",40
Phoebe,"

Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.",12
Joey," Thanks for coming Mrs.

Greene. (grabs her and kisses her to distract her. She goes limp in his arms.

Mr. Green leaves.) Well, ok, you take care.",27
Joey,"

Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.",13
Rachel," Ok, I've got one. (blows

out the candles. Somebody calls out 'heads up' and the volleyball lands in the

flan) Wow, those things almost never come true.",27
Rachel," 
(brings a muffin to Chandler 

and Monica who are sitting on the couch) Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one 

banana nut muffin left.


(Rachel holds the tray between them. Chandler grabs the muffin before Monica 

can.)",36
Chandler,"

Ok, you can have it. (He licks it and offers it to her.)",13
Monica," 

(She grabs the coffee cup on the table and licks the rim.) There you go, enjoy

your coffee.",18
Chandler," 

That was there when I got here. (Takes a bite of his muffin.)",13
Phoebe," 

(enters) Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.",13
Monica," 

(Chandler tries to come back with a smart-ass remark but can't swallow the

muffin.) Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.",22
Phoebe,"

Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.


(Chandler is visibly upset)",17
Phoebe,"

Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw

in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.",25
Joey,"

Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?",10
Phoebe,"

No. No, he is my submarine guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we

have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two

weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.",36
Rachel,"

So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?


(Once again, Chandler has a bite in his mouth and can't come back.)",26
Ross,"

Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.",11
Ross,"

Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.",14
Monica,"

Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This

isn't camp.",18
Monica,"

Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.",10
Monica,"

I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.",15
Monica,"

Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the

bottom right corner.",20
Monica,"

Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not

down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't

love me any more do you.",35
Chandler,"

Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can

get you a job right here as an entry level processor.",27
Joey,"

But don't you need experience for a job like that?",10
Chandler,"

It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what

you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think

you're a processor.",32
Chandler,"

Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.",12
Joey,"

Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.",14
Joey,"

Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing,

the next day you're not so much... processing any more.",27
Chandler,"

I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.",11
Phoebe,"

Yeah? Are you sure, really. (She picks up a mirror and sees the white splotches 

all over her face.)",19
Rachel,"

You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.",11
Phoebe,"

Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.",13
Phoebe,"

'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you

have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.",24
Phoebe,"

Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.",14
Phoebe,"

Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.",11
Phoebe,"

And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This

is me... (she unveils herself right as a huge lightning bolt crashes outside.

Ryan screams in terror.) Oh, I am scary.",36
Phoebe,"

I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for

us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.",33
Joey,"

Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one

column into another column.",17
Joey,"

Hey and everybody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red

hair, Jeannie.",20
Joey,"

Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?",13
Chandler,"

Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.",13
Joey,"

Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My

character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany.

Ashley copies everything Brittany does.",31
Joey,"

Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know

what? Just did.",18
Phoebe,"

Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. (She picks up the dice.) Here we go, double

sixes, here we go...(She starts to rub the dice all over herself.) Here we go,

come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...",40
Phoebe,"

No. Here. (Throws them on the table.) There. Ooh, double sixes.",11
Phoebe,"

Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all

these houses and rub 'em all over my body. (Grabs a handful of the houses.)",31
Phoebe,"

Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's

just be bad, it'll feel so good. (She starts scratching him.)",28
Phoebe,"

Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.


(They get back to back and start rubbing against each other. Ross and Rachel 

enter.)",25
Ross,"

You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military

man.",16
Joey,"

You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring

the kids, we'll make a day of it.",24
Chandler,"

Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto

nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.",19
Chandler,"

Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their

families.",14
Chandler,"

It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you

wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.",28
Joey," 

This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas?",13
Joey,"

Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya

know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.",23
Monica,"

This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mitts to their hands.",15
Monica,"

Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything

on your desk is perpendicular?",30
Monica,"

No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?",17
Monica,"

No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.",11
Monica," 

You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't 

believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing!",28
Chandler,"

Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?",10
Joey,"

'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender

project.",15
Joey," 

Because at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it,

turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.",27
Chandler,"

Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a

lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately

that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.",42
Chandler,"

I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.",13
Joey,"

Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your

department.",16
Chandler,"

Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.",16
Chandler,"

Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I

just did.",17
Joey,"

Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man?!",10
Chandler,"

Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who

seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day

at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.",43
Joey,"

Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something

else.",17
Phoebe,"

Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.",11
Rachel,"

And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but

that shouldn't be a problem for you.",23
Phoebe,"

It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.


(Ross and Rachel leave.)",16
Phoebe,"

Please. (Ryan pulls the cork with his teeth and spits it into Phoebe's mitts.)",14
Phoebe,"

Oh.


(They start to kiss. They try to get each other's shirts off but can't get the 

buttons undone.)",19
Monica,"

No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on

this side of the bed.",23
Monica,"

No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.",18
Ross,"

So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?",10
Rachel,"

Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingies.",14
Rachel,"

So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?",15
Phoebe,"

I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a

picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that.

(They kiss.)",34
Phoebe,"

Bye you. (Ryan's cab drives off. As Phoebe is going back in, she sees the 

Central Perk sign in the window and laughs.)",23
Rachel,"

Well then uh, we better make this night count. (He starts to carry her out.) Oh

wait, I forgot to turn off the cappuccino machine. (He carries her over to turn

it off.) Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my

purse, my purse. (He carries her to the counter to pick up her purse.) Oh, you

know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.",73
Ross," Alright you know, why don't

I just meet you upstairs. (Drops her on the couch and walks out holding his 

lower back.) ",22
Rachel, Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.,12
Phoebe," See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's

The Boss.",17
Ross," Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of

Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.",20
Phoebe," Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I

could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a

opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the

phone call.",55
Chandler," Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.",10
Chandler," Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from

work today and just hang out with me.",21
Chandler," I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting

divorced. I'm such a grown up. Joey, hey, go to your room!",26
Chandler," Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.",12
Joey," Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking,

that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.",23
Chandler," (looks him in the eye) I'm not breaking up with her! (they stare at

each other for a while, then Joey blows in his face)",25
Monica," It's some of Richard's hair! (holds it close to Ross) What do I do with

this?",16
Monica," It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this

is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! (drops it in Ross's cereal)",32
Phoebe," Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your

cereal. (Ross gives her this look, like 'Yeah, doesn't it', and gets up to dump it down

the drain.)",32
Monica," I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of

wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!",23
Joey," (entering) Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking

up. He didn't blink or anything.",17
Rachel," Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together,

they're really cute.",16
Rachel," Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his

girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?",20
Joey," There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All

right who's first? Huh? Ross?",20
Ross," Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy,

so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.",25
Joey," Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right? 

Come on people, we need some inspiration!",15
Phoebe," Yeah, ok. All right, you want a plan? 

Here we go, all right.  So umm ok Ross, you go into the air duct and 

disable the alarm, okay? And then the rest of us will just rappel down ropes. 

We're in and out in ten minutes (snaps fingers) and then disappear into the 

night. Huh, huh? ",56
Rachel," (she leans over and kisses him on the cheek) Honey, I was wondering....",13
Ross," Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.",10
Ross, I think I have an old band uniform from high school.,11
Rachel," I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?",12
Ross," Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?",11
Ross," Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? 

He was this uh...really fat worm guy.  ",17
Ross," No no no see Jabba had as, as

his prisoner, um, Princess Leia. ",13
Ross," Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty

cool.",13
Rachel," (seductively) So are you saying you 

would like me to....dress up like Princess Leia in a gold bikini?",18
Phoebe," Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved

that.",14
Phoebe," Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she

stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.",23
Phoebe, No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!,17
Ross," Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a

parking meter.",15
Ross," Yeah,  Statistical 

Deviations In the Carbon Dating of Fossilized Algae colon History or 

Mystery?",14
Phoebe," Rach, look! (she holds two buns up to her ears to make her hair look

like the Princess Leia 'do.) Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.

(Ross stands up horrified) There he is.",39
Joey, Fortune! This guy is so stupid. (yelling) It's Count Rushmore!!,10
Chandler," You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got

three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?",23
Joey," I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?",11
Joey," Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go

together, we're like the three hocke-teers.",20
Chandler," You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a

problem with Janice?",21
Joey," No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. (walks into the kitchen, Chandler

follows closely, he turns around and gets startled). Oh, hi, you know that girl from the

Greek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?",44
Chandler," Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!",13
Joey," Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.",13
Joey," Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you

nuts before too, remember?",20
Chandler," Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing.

Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry, those are the right letters.",29
Joey," What's the point? It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts

laughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can have

something to throw at her. ",37
Chandler," Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and by

the way there is no Count Rushmore!",20
Joey," Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?

(Chandler gives him a look like 'You stupid idiot!')",21
Rachel," Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.",11
Ross," Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.",11
Rachel," Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?",10
Ross," Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.",13
Rachel," Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other

everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that

locker room stuff.",32
Ross," That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who

did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.",22
Ross," Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your

girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.",22
Rachel," That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding

and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same

thing you are.",33
Ross," Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the

night of five times? ",19
Phoebe," ( in a soothing voice) Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the

plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me

your happy place.",33
Phoebe," All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And

get out!",17
Phoebe," Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to

ask that you don't move anything.",20
Phoebe," Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....",14
Monica, Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?,11
Phoebe," All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the

warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....",22
Monica," I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.",10
Phoebe," All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not

permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and

the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....",37
Monica," Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.",13
Joey," (groans and nervously answers the door) Janice. (laughs 

nervously) Hi, you just missed Chandler, but won't you come in before you go? 

(she does so) ",25
Joey," I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.",12
Joey, And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...,13
Phoebe, Ooh you hate Janice now? Oh! Joey's going to be so relieved.,12
Rachel," Oh my god. (Monica is outside the window mouthing something 

and crying hysterically. Rachel goes outside to get her.) ",19
Monica," (crying) So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was

those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.",31
Monica," Uh, huh. (to Ross) Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. (Rachel, Monica,

and Phoebe leave)",17
Ross," No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique,

stamina, girth....",13
Chandler," Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this? ",12
Ross," Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing

it. Do you wanna?",16
Ross," So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies,

and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....",24
Chandler," Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.",12
Chandler," And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these

like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the

Xerox place....",32
Chandler," I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And

your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't

possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's

kinda like, you're, you know. You know...(Ross just stares at him). You don't know!",61
Ross," Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the

matter with you?",17
Ross," I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! (Chandler

goes over and sits at a table and puts his head down).",22
Joey," Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I

love this woman. You have got competition buddy.",24
Chandler," Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.",10
Joey," But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day

together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea

Stadium.",35
Joey," No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means

I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.",30
Joey," Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into

Ross.",15
Joey," Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.",12
Joey," Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.",11
Monica," I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you

really doing here Dad?",20
Monica, What makes you think that I might not be okay?,10
Monica," I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?",11
Monica," Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?",15
Rachel," Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look

on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What?

Did you just picture it differently? What? What?",42
Ross," No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's (turns and sees his Mom

standing where Rachel is)",20
Ross," I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life. (Rachel starts looking around

and down, with a 'What the hell is going on?' look on her face.)",26
Joey," Gee...

you know I wish there was something I could do to help you.",14
Phoebe," Like

a straw? (Rachel and Chandler look confused) Remember crazy

straws? (demonstrates them in the air with her hands)",19
Chandler," (going to the bedroom) See Joe, that's why your parents told you not

to jump on the bed.",18
Monica," Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this

morning.",15
Monica, Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.,14
Joey," No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. (points to the sling he is

wearing)",17
Rachel, Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?,15
Joey, Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.,14
Chandler," Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it

just *fell* out of the socket.",20
Joey," Whoa, jam! I love jam! (to Chandler) Hey, how come we never have jam at

our place?",17
Monica," I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed

about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man?

Jam. (sees Joey trying some jam from the pot) Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. (Joey

realizes this and spits what he had in his mouth back into the pot.)",61
Phoebe," (turns around) Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have

you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.",28
Phoebe," Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.",11
Phoebe," Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is

just what, what she does to guys, okay.",23
Phoebe," Wait, (grabs him) you know what, I got a little story. When I was in

Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was

this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He

said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?",65
Phoebe," Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice

guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.",27
Phoebe," Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?",13
Phoebe," Okay. (they start to leave, he is still following her) Okay, you don't

have to walk behind me any more.",20
Rachel," Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes (Ross starts

kissing her neck) Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.

(they fall onto the couch)",37
Rachel," Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. (to Chandler) Hey.",10
Chandler," Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that

to mean that I was calling her a cow. ",24
Rachel," Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.",10
Chandler," Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at

her....",16
Ross," Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's

just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?",32
Rachel," Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.",13
Ross," Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she

gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2

is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?",43
Ross," (buzzes) Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number

three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.",24
Chandler," Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice

likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to

go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know,

accidentally calling her fat or something.",57
Rachel," Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're 

cuddly

sleepers. (Chandler makes an 'Ewww' face) Okay, I'm late for work.",23
Ross," (blows her a kiss) Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but

there is something you can do.",18
Ross," Noo! No, not cuddly, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room.

Okay, come here. (they sit on the couch and Ross puts his hands on Chandler's shoulder and

thigh.) Okay, you're in bed...",37
Ross," Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for

her to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her back

over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.",49
Joey," Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the

movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?",25
Phoebe," Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him

today.",15
Joey, (with food in his mouth) You talked to him. Are you crazy?,12
Phoebe," Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his

name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was

Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause

of the restraining order.",53
Phoebe," Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this

very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a teensy bit carried away, you

know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.",42
Ross," Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.",11
Phoebe," No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you

know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.",24
Joey," (with his mouthful) Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean (he sprays Phoebe with

crumbs) ",15
Monica," Joey, this is for you. (gives him a jar of jam) It's blackberry currant.",14
Chandler," Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds

up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)",29
Monica," Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.",10
Monica," I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even.

So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.",23
Monica," Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my

life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's

when I came up with the baby plan. ",41
Ross," Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that

guy's name? Dad!",16
Monica," It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if

I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just

stupid.",38
Monica," I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And

there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.",25
Chandler," Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self) 'Look at

all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird

though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes!

Freedom! (his one arm is still under her) Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay,

time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat!

And 1...2...3!' (Pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)",92
Phoebe," Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going

strong. Keep going.",14
Chandler," No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.",11
Monica," (entering from her bedroom) Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on

down! Okay, he's 6'2"", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.",26
Ross," Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna,

I'm, I'm gonna.....",18
Rachel," Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.",12
Monica," What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to

something....",14
Monica," Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so

ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?",30
Joey," Let me see. (goes over and looks at the form) Oh, right.",12
Joey," Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. (to Chandler) Hey,

Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?",23
Joey," Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised

there's any of my boys left.",18
Monica," Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket

scientist here.",15
Joey," Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives'

on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.",26
Phoebe," Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He

quit for me.",18
Rachel," Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how

long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.",23
Phoebe," Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.",10
Ross, You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?,12
Phoebe," What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following

her?",14
Monica," I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.",14
Joey," Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.",10
Rachel," Oh my God, what happened? (points to the cast on Janice's wrist)",12
Phoebe," Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich.

Oh, here it is! Oh. (picks one up out of the garbage can.)",29
Phoebe," Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you

were still hung up on my sister.",21
Phoebe," Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just

walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you

know she takes this train?",34
Phoebe," No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I

made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause

your, you know (in a high pitched voice) Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely

help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be

like an Ursula patch.",70
Phoebe," Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the

pillar, which way am I gonna go? ",20
Joey," I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall,

smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.",21
Joey," It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big

pool.",17
Joey," Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great

kids.",17
Monica," And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're,

they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of

them.",30
Joey," Sure! (Monica gets very depressed) But hey, you know this way sounds good

too. ",14
Joey," Oh Monica. (goes over and hugs her, then looks at the form and 

stops hugging her.) Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, (sees 

Monica) for like a day. (hugs her again)",34
Monica," She'll be back at 5! (Malcom motions he 

can't hear her.) (Monica holds up her hand as does Joey) Five! (Malcom gives 

thumbs up and leaves.) ",26
Joey," I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of

Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it (tries to drink the rest of

the jam out of the jar and gets it all over his face, on his chin, nose, etc.) Maybe if

they met me in person.",55
Rachel," Honey, you got a little thing on your...(points to her whole face)",12
Joey, (wipes a little jam from the corner of his mouth) Did I get it?,14
Ross," (sees Joey) Hey. (walks into the living room) Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I

talk to you for a second?",21
Ross," Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your

already familiar with, uh, women talk! (smacks Chandler over the head with a magazine)",24
Joey," You guys, can we please not watch this all right.",10
Joey," (on tv) Oh, you said it Mike. (rips open the carton and spills milk on the

counter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!",25
Joey," (on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy.

(starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.",23
Phoebe," All right, you've suffered enough. We'll change it. We'll 

change it. (She does so and there appears another infomercial with Joey in it. 

This time he is wearing a moustache trying to sow something. )",35
Monica," Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, (turns sideways on the

couch) so that you can bunny bump against my back.",23
Joey," Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at

the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How

could you not give me the message?!",42
Chandler," Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.",13
Phoebe," Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! (they all stare at her) Okay, it was

me! ",17
Phoebe," Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was

in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet.

I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. (shows him

her hand)",58
Phoebe," Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.",10
Joey," Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed

my chance.",15
Phoebe, That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.,14
Joey," Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends,

she only talks to agents.",17
Phoebe," What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh (starts dialing). ",12
Phoebe," No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. (on the phone in a different voice)

'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe,

she'll know what it's about.'",35
Joey," Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs it and he

tries to reach the phone with his other arm but can't because of the sling.)",30
Phoebe," (on phone) 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani,

apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't

know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down

the apartment, the world does not stop.'",54
Phoebe," (on phone) 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is

it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' (to

Monica) I need a pen. (Chandler hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so she

tilts Chandler's head over and writes on the back of his neck)",61
Chandler, Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!,14
Rachel," (passes by the window caring laundry) 

Huh. Well, that's funny. Ugly Naked Guy is still naked but his dog is wearing a 

sweater. ",23
Ross," There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbiee (Ben is holding a

Barbiee doll) What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbiee?",25
Ross," Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?",13
Ross," You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbie thing, so

am I.",15
Ross," Give daddy the Barbie! Ben, give, give me the 

Barbie.

Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? (makes a monster truck

sound) No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-solider? (squawks like a dinosaur)",39
Rachel," Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?

(uses the Milk Master 2000 to pour milk into her cereal)",25
Monica," (entering from her bedroom) I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left

boob?",15
Joey, I love that movie. (Joey is using it as a pillow),11
Chandler, (entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.,10
Joey," Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me.

Go get me a sweater.",21
Chandler," Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see

her tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.",32
Rachel, What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?,10
Chandler," Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her

chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.",22
Ross," You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to

you.",13
Rachel," Men are unbelievable. Janice just 

thought she was giving you chicken.  She didn't think she was giving you 

scary chicken.",20
Monica," What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel

something, you have to run away?",20
Chandler," I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of

thought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say

something stupid.",31
Monica," Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until

you get us to break up with you.",22
Chandler," Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of

the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side! ",29
Chandler," Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest) Do we

have any thoughts here?",16
Joey," Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand

it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it

seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear

of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.

Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the

most committed guy there ever was.",91
Joey," Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of

the gun, pee into the wind!",22
Chandler," Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm

pretty much peeing every which way.",21
Phoebe," Will you guys listen to this and tell me 

what you think? (Gets ready to play and her beeper goes off.)  

That's interesting. ",23
Phoebe," Oh, cause it's a beeper. Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?",18
Rachel," Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and

pretend agents.",13
Phoebe," (on phone, in 'Katelynn's' voice) 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a

page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'",26
Phoebe," (in voice, on phone) 'Okay, go ahead.' (in normal voice on phone) Um, hi

Annie. (listens) Fantastic! (to Joey) You got it. (on phone) Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work

for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, (Joey clears his throat to signify

yes) except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to

have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next....(hangs up phone) Op, went through a

tunnel.",83
Phoebe," It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.",14
Joey," You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's

this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.",29
Phoebe," Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.",11
Joey," Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.",13
Joey," Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love

you.",15
Chandler," 'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)",12
Chandler," Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into

your brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.",29
Chandler," Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what

girlfriends should, should get. ",17
Chandler," Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's

more. We should take a trip.",18
Chandler," Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your

parents. We should take a trip with your parents!",23
Chandler," I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have

feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably

say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.",42
Chandler," Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm

hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! (Janice leaves, Chandler then calls Janice

to leave a message on her machine) Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna

apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. (runs out the door)",57
Rachel," Honey, this will help. (hands him a tub of ice cream)",11
Chandler," So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going

to fast and we have to slow down.",22
Monica," Well, was it ""please"" with one ""e"" in the middle of it or lots 

of ""e's"" ?",17
Rachel," Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so

bad. How did you leave it?",20
Rachel," Yeah, well that's that low-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we

save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.",23
Monica," You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch

to low-fat.",16
Monica," Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some

damage control.",16
Rachel," This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching

for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want

her back you have to start acting aloof.",39
Rachel," Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her

on purpose. And then act aloof.",21
Ross," Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. (singing) 'A

real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbie, drop the 

Barbie.",25
Rachel, G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?,11
Ross," Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!",11
Joey," But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe! (catches her in the hallway)",11
Phoebe," Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in

those....pants.",12
Joey," Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I

got a shot at it.",21
Phoebe," Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it,

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",19
Phoebe," But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible,

terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.",29
Joey," I'm, I'm okay. See. (tries to smile, but fails horribly)",10
Phoebe," Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit,

okay, I just quit.",19
Joey," No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs,

rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.",26
Phoebe," Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian

actor with a worse Italian accent.",18
Phoebe," Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...",14
Joey," No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You

know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. (in

a very bad Italian accent) I canna work on a new accent.",45
Ross," (running into the hall, in slow motion) You'll never get me, Joe!!! (he

then pretends that he gets shot repeatedly and falls back against Joey and Chandler's

door, dead.)",29
Chandler," (in accent) Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?",11
Chandler," Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a

party. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)",23
Chandler," Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.",11
Phoebe," Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on. ",14
Phoebe," No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can

work on that. ",16
Phoebe," Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'",11
Joey," Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this

Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.",25
Joey," Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at

least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.",28
Joey," Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of

being my agent.",19
Phoebe," (in a coy tone) Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.",12
Joey," (in a really, really bad Italian accent) That's-ah what I suspected-ah.",11
Chandler," ....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran

out of the store.",19
Monica," My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.",10
Chandler," I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream

now, right?",15
Monica," You know what, everything's gonna be okay. 

You know why? Cause you got 65 grams of fat coming your way.   ",20
Chandler," (answering phone) Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second?

Okay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay, what do I do?",22
Rachel," Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.",10
Monica, If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.,12
Monica," Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke

up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.",25
Chandler," What are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm

so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just

because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a

couple of more times. I'm sorry. (listens) Really?! (listens) Really?!",53
Rachel," He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody

else by now.",16
Monica," Aw, it's soo unfair. (they both start digging into the 'good' ice cream)",13
Ross," Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.",14
Ross," Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbie's out. And if you guys can't

deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'",19
Monica," What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbie, big deal. You

used to dress up like a woman.",23
Monica," Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.",12
Monica, How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea. ,10
Ross, There was no song. (to Monica) There was no song!,10
Ross, (coming out of the bathroom) Won't you dance around with me. ,11
Monica," A-ha!!! (they all start laughing, as Ross hides in the bathroom)",11
Joey, No. Y'know how we’re always saying we need a place for the mail.,13
Joey," Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next

step.",16
Joey," No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It’s a

one day job, max.",17
Chandler," Okay. (notices that Joey is wearing some really tight jeans) My word!

Those are snug.",15
Joey," Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente’s.",10
Phoebe," Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know,

‘Frank’s always late.’",14
Phoebe," No, I know, I’m just nervous. Y'know it’s just y'know

Mom’s dead, don’t talk to my sister, Grandma’s been sleeping a lot lately.

It’s like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing.

You’re so sweet to wait with me.",43
Rachel," Well, actually Gunther sent me. You’re not allowed to have cups out

here, it’s a thing. (takes her cup and goes back inside)",23
Monica," No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.",10
Chandler," All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put

him on her freebie list.",19
Chandler," Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that

we can sleep with, and the other one can’t get mad.",25
Ross," Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex

with celebrities.",13
Chandler," Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah,

Jessica Rabbit.",13
Rachel," Now, you do realize that she’s a cartoon, and way out of your

league?",14
Chandler," I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop

out of her head.",20
Joey," Man this is such a great thing. Y'know, 

Annie Esposito would never have dumped me had we had a list like this, 

you know?.  And also of course if her sister was famous. Hey, Monica, who would yours be?",39
Monica," First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.",11
Joey," It’s just a game Mon. (makes a ‘Can-you-believe-her’ face

to the rest of the gang.) Rach, how about you?",19
Rachel," Oh, I don’t know, I guess, Chris O’Donnel, John F. Kennedy,

Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.",19
Rachel," What about you honey, who would be on your list?",10
Ross," Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First,

I’ll divide my perspective candidates into categories....",18
Phoebe, (entering) Everybody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.,10
Rachel," Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?",12
Phoebe," Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we’re gonna connect, y'know bond, and

everything.",11
Chandler," You know, we don’t really take advantage of living in the city.",12
Chandler," No, you didn’t get me!! It’s an electric drill, you get

me, you kill me!!",15
Joey," Well, you should’ve told me that before, I’m not a mind reader.

Hey, we’re out of beer. I’m going to Monica’s.",21
Chandler," Fine! (goes into his room and slams the door, then he slams the bottom

half of the door.)",18
Joey," Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those

designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.",28
Monica, I highly doubt that. (they both go to the bathroom),10
Joey," Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to

be. (Monica gasps) Yeah.",20
Monica, I can’t live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?,15
Joey," Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comes

right off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in

his tight pants.)",35
Joey," (manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch of

this stuff is glued down. It’d take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should

just leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)",43
Monica, I can’t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.,12
Monica," You know that’s nice, y'know we could put it back there after the

surgeons remove it from your colon! Give me a new floor!",24
Joey," I can't Monica. Chandler would kill me if 

I don't finish the unit.",13
Monica," Triple! (Joey is about to leave but then 

turns around intrigued.)",11
Phoebe," Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue?

Because I can, and my Mom couldn’t, and I thought y'know, I figured that was

something I got from our Dad.",36
Phoebe," Yeah, yeah. You can do it to. (tries to do it, but can’t)",13
Phoebe," Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can’t. We don’t have

that....",14
Phoebe," That’s the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda

things do you like to do at home?",18
Rachel, Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.,11
Ross," Yeah, it’s hard okay, I only have two spots left.",10
Chandler," All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?",11
Chandler," Eh, y'know what, she’s too political, she probably wouldn’t

let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.",21
Chandler," Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she’s too

international, y'know she’s never gonna be around.",17
Chandler," So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who’s gonna be in the

country like all the time.",18
Rachel," Yeah, ‘cause that’s why you won’t get Isabella Rosselini,

geography.",10
Phoebe," Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I’m just gonna go to bed, I

think the fumes are giving me a headache.",22
Phoebe," Here. (gives him a fire extinguisher) Y'know, just in case.",10
Phoebe," So far, it kinda blows. I don’t know, I just thought y'know that

he’d feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and

connected and....",30
Monica," Oh honey, we’re close now but you-you wouldn’t believe the

years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and....(Phoebe

shakes her head like she doesn’t understand) That’s where the waistband actually

goes over your head. ",38
Monica," Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.",12
Chandler," Oh, just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of

his pants.) Y’know what it’s my fault really, because the couch is usually where

we keep the varnish.",33
Joey," (yelling from bathroom) Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those

tiles.",13
Monica, He’s retiling my floor. (they both run to the bathroom),10
Phoebe," Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.

(Both Monica and Chandler look at her. She then walks 

off.) ",19
Joey," Woah, woah, woah woah.  You guys 

figure it out. I'm going to go take a little break. (goes to sit down)",21
Joey," Yeah, I think even God rested on the 

seventh day. (sits down on Monica's couch)",15
Monica," (grabs his shirt)  Joey if this 

takes seven days you'll be able to meet God and ask him about it yourself! (Joey 

proceeds to Monica's bathroom as Chandler motions him to go to their apartment.)

",35
Phoebe," Yeah. (phone rings and Phoebe answers it) ‘Hello. (listens) Oh my

God, I totally forgot! (listens) Well can’t someone else do it. (listens) But, I have

company. (listens) Yeah, no look, that’s all right I’ll come in.’ (hangs up

phone) Um, Frank, I’m really sorry but I have to go to work. It’s-it’s one

of my regulars and he’s insisting that I do ‘um.",64
Phoebe, Oh! I’m a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.,10
Phoebe," All righty. I’ll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come

with me?",15
Phoebe," No, no, you can get one yourself. It’ll be on the house! Y'know

what are big sisters for?",18
Phoebe," No, no, no, I wouldn’t do you myself, I mean that would be weird.

Yeah, no, I’ll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun!

Hey! Are you excited?",37
Monica," It’s beautiful! It’s like the first bathroom floor there ever

was. (Chandler tries to go to the bathroom) Whoa! Are you going in there for?",25
Ross," Okay, I’m done with my choices, these are final. (holds up a little

card)",14
Ross," Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.",11
Rachel," All right let me see. (grabs the card) Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder,

Elizabeth Hurley, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hamill? ",19
Rachel," Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.",12
Phoebe," Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like

five minutes.",17
Phoebe," (turns around and hits Frank) So that’s what you thought I did!!

God! That’s not what I do!",18
Phoebe," Whatever, it’s the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.",10
Phoebe," Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?",10
Phoebe," Okay. All right, this is my favorite part of the weekend, right now,

this.",14
Monica,"  (sees something of Phoebe's on the 

table) Hey Phoebe, what's that?",11
Phoebe," Oh! Frank Jr. gave me this before 

he left. It's a present.  It used to belong to our dad. It's his garage 

door opener until Frank melted it.   ",28
Phoebe," (starts to press the button on the 

garage door opener and Monica and Rachel's TV starts changing channels.) Cool!",19
Chandler," No seriously, can you help us? (The 

girls get up.)  ",10
Chandler," Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this

‘two’ talk.",14
Chandler," Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller! ",11
Joey," Look it’s not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a

little of my door.",19
Chandler," Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how ‘bout it blocks

none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move

it, but it doesn’t move.)",36
Joey," Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.",10
Chandler," (tries to remove himself from the unit 

unsuccessfully)  Arm hair stuck! Arm hair stuck! (tries again 

unsuccessfully) ",17
Rachel," Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf,

double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? (the guy

nods) Okay, great. (she starts to walk away and under her breath) You freak.",46
Ross, Damn! I can’t believe I took her off my list.,10
Rachel," Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.",12
Ross," Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.",11
Rachel," You know what honey, you go ahead, we’ll call her an alternate.",12
Rachel," Honey, he’s about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I’m just

sorry we don’t got popcorn.",16
Ross," (to Isabella) Hi! Hi, I’m Ross, you don’t know me, but I’m

a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I

could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? (Gunther hands her change) Or maybe reimburse you

for that one? ",50
Ross," Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that’s okay, see we have an understanding,

um, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so I’m allowed

to sleep with you. No, no, no, it’s flattering.",38
Ross," Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don’t, don’t just dismiss

this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...",24
Ross," Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler

(Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped

you for Wynona Rider, local.",35
Ross, (to the rest of the gang) We’re just gonna be friends.,11
Joey, I bet ‘ya ya I could fit in there. (points to a hole in the center),16
Chandler," Yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so

that the doors won’t open) I’m out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack

between the door and frame) Here you go.",39
Joey," Thank you. Cha-ching! (Chandler starts to leave) Oh, well hello Mr.

Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. (Chandler leaves and closes the door) And the drinks

are on me!",29
Rachel," Yeah. And you know what? If that doesn't 

change soon, I'm going to dump you for somebody who puts out. ",20
Joey," Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.",12
Joey," Okay, but let’s say there was. How might that go?",10
Phoebe, Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.,10
Monica," (entering from bedroom) Okay, I’ll be back in just a minute. Oh,

Phoebe I’m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.",23
Ross," Hey, y'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister

that you don’t live here anymore.",19
Ross," Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she

doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that

you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.",34
Ross," You have got to tell her. Okay, the longer 

you wait the harder it's going to be on her. ",19
Phoebe," You're right, you're right. (grabs her bag) Anyway, 

listen..umm...tonight's bag is really bulky so you could sneak some stuff out 

for me? (pulls out the stuff) It's just like a clock radio and some sanitary 

dirt. ",36
Chandler," Well let’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that’s

plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need

to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing!

Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!",51
Chandler," Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy,

who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone

‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’",32
Monica," (entering) Ross (who has his foot on the coffee table), foot on the

floor or come over no more!",19
Ross," (to Phoebe) Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.",11
Ross," I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...",12
Ross," Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were

having so much trouble lately.",18
Ross," Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn’t really have any

close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan

something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it’s gonna make a difference",45
Chandler," Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?",10
Chandler," Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.",10
Chandler," Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless

it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good. (Eric offers

to shake hands) All right. (Chandler hugs him.)",38
Chandler," (running around the apartment pointing out things) Bedroom. Bathroom.

Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, (opens door)

Bye-bye.",25
Joey," Don’t you ah, don’t you wanna ask me any questions?",10
Joey," Well, ah, I’m an actor. I’m fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV.

Oh, and don’t worry I’m totally okay with the gay thing.",26
Joey," Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I’m totally cool

with that.",14
Monica," Yeah, apparently they’re turning it into some kinda coffee place.",10
Chandler," Oh yes, and that’s what I want a roommate that I can walk around

with and be referred to as the funny one.",23
Monica," Oh look, the pool table’s free. Rack ‘em up. I’ll be back

in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.",24
Rachel," (sitting at a table with some of her friends) (to waitress) Oh, um, no,

no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I

ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don’t think this is.",44
Rachel," That’s all right. (to her friends) I mean hard is it to get a

couple drinks right, huh?",18
Rachel," Ummm, I think it’s time to see the ring again. (holds her hand out

and they all scream)",18
Rachel," Oh, I don’t know. Well maybe it’s just the idea of Barry for

the rest of my life. I don’t know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling,

y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. (Chandler is listening in very intensely)",49
Rachel," I’m serious, I really, I think I need just to have

some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.",21
Chandler," (picks it up) And now I’ve picked it up again. (walks over to

Monica.)",14
Monica," Oh my God, I went to high school with her. (to Rachel) Rachel! Hi!",14
Rachel," Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think? (shows her, her ring)",11
Monica," Oh my God, you can’t even see where the Titanic hit it.",12
Rachel," Yes, his name is Barry, he’s a doctor, thank you very much.",12
Rachel," Thank you. So how-how ‘bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?",10
Rachel," Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. (points at Chandler, who holds up the

cue ball as a ‘Remember me?’ thing) Listen, can we please have lunch the next

time I’m in the city?",33
Monica," Bye! (to Chandler) Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my

life.",15
Ross," No real-, honey, really it’s fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I,

no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye",25
Monica," Oh, well don’t take it to the same place you took the stereo,

‘cause they’ve had that thing for over a week.",22
Phoebe," No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.",12
Phoebe," Then I’m gonna have to ask you to keep it down. (slams the door in

his face.)",17
Chandler," Oh, don’t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I

gotta get to get to work. And not just for the money.  

But also because every now and then somebody walks out of the bathroom with a 

little bit of toilet paper on their shoe. (laughs 

as he leaves) ",52
Joey," Oh, no thanks, I got it. (picks it up) No I don’t!",12
Joey," Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.",10
Monica," It’s the heat. (has her hand on his chest, and then pulls it away)

And-and the humidity.",17
Joey," Like you wouldn’t believe. (they go into the apartment) Wow! This is

a great place.",15
Monica," This place is really my Grandmother’s. (Joey starts to take off all

of his clothes, while Monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.) I got it from her

when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the

landlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR. So are you

thirsty?",63
Monica," (turning around) Okay, here’s your penis! Oh my God!!! What 

the hell are you doing?!!",15
Joey," Whoa, ah!! We’re you just gonna give me some lemonade?",10
Monica," I don’t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to

you that means they wanna have sex?",20
Joey," Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.

Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I’m such a jerk.",23
Monica," It’s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know,

but... By the way I can still see it.",22
Phoebe," It’s not in the apartment? (Monica gives a ‘Come on’

look) Oh no. I can’t believe this is happening again.",20
Phoebe," Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I’ve, I don’t live here

anymore.",12
Phoebe," I’m sorry, I-I-I-I don’t live here anymore. I-I didn’t

know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!",19
Phoebe," That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. ",11
Monica," I don't understand this. I thought we 

were doing so much better lately.",13
Phoebe," Yeah, 

because I moved out.  Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I 

couldn’t sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the 

sofa cushions. ",35
Phoebe," Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other

side.",14
Phoebe," Okay, this is what I’m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a

land where people can spill.",19
Phoebe," Aw, honey it’s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I

love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don’t see that

happening.",34
Monica," Well, why can't I think of both?!  

I mean I can think two things! ",14
Phoebe," Go ahead look! You know you want to! 

(Monica does so and finds the stain.)",15
Chandler," Well, it sounds kinda stupid... (looks at the TV) Who’s she?",11
Joey," They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?",10
Joey," No, no, no, don’t get up, I got a cooler right here.",12
Monica," I don’t understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I

don’t have a boyfriend?",19
Chandler," Noo!! You don’t have a boyfriend because....I don’t, I

don’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.",22
Chandler," Oh-ho, come here. (goes and hugs her) Listen, you are one of my

favorite people and the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known in real life.",26
Phoebe," Oh, it’s already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is

wrong?",14
Ross," My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.",11
Ross," ‘Cause Carol’s a lesbian. (Phoebe is shocked) And, and I’m

not one. And apparently it’s not a mix and match situation.",21
Phoebe," Oh my God! I don’t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.",11
Ross," (sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, many

drinks) I’m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I’d be out and

she’d, she’d see some beautiful woman, and, and she’d be Ross y'know look

at her, and I’d think, God, my wife is cool!",55
Phoebe," Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?",11
Ross," Seven years. I mean we’ve been together seven years, she’s the

only woman who’s ever loved me, and the only woman I’ve-I’ve ever....",23
Chandler," No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?",14
Chandler," I mean, it's look nubby but...but it's 

not.  Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle

a nuclear device.",24
Monica," Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.",10
Chandler," Oh yeah, that sounds great. (starts to leave) Oh, and listen,

it’s, it’s gonna be....",15
Ross," Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or

I’d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can’t believe this!",23
Phoebe," I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross.

You’re, you’re really, you’re so good. (kisses him on the cheek)",23
Phoebe," And you’re so sweet. (kisses him on the other cheek) And

you’re kind (kisses him on the lips)",18
Ross," No, come on don’t start. (they start kissing again) Ouch!",10
Ross, Stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls),10
Ross, Oh well. It probably wouldn't have been the most constructive solution.,11
Phoebe," Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought this

was real grass.",15
Rachel," Don’t say anything. I don’t wanna speak, I don’t wanna

think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.",30
Ross," So I told Carl, ‘Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are,

nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.’ But of course this went in one ear and

out.....",30
Rachel," I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend

he’s Alan Alda.",18
Monica," Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?",11
Chandler," If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that

would be the best.",16
Ross," Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were

you? I was always Richie.",18
Joey," Question. Was ah, ‘Egg the Gellers!’ the war cry of your

neighborhood?",12
Chandler," (to Janice) Don’t look honey. Change the channel! Change the

channel!",11
Monica," I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about

the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. (they all stare at her) And I’m

appalled for you by the way.",34
Chandler," Oh, you know what?  I asked for no cinnamon on top. ",11
Monica," Oh. (scoops it out with her hand like Ross does in the future 

episode The One With the Hypnosis Tape)",20
Rachel," ‘Okay. (listens) Okay, daddy we’ll see you tomorrow night.

(listens) Okay bye-bye.’ (hangs up)",14
Rachel," Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that’s

okay.",13
Ross," Oh shoot, tomorrow’s not so good, I’m supposed to um, fall off

the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.",25
Rachel," But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all

right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you

like I do. (Ross looks at her) All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do

come to dinner, I’ll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.",67
Chandler," See, that’s why I could never be an actor. Because I can’t

say gig.",14
Joey," Well, it’s not a part, no. I’m teaching acting for soap operas

down at the Learning Extension.",17
Joey," Yeah, yeah. It’s like my chance to give something back to the acting

community.",14
Ross, Y’know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.,12
Phoebe," Ugh! I don’t know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if

you buy a bed from Janice’s ex-husband, that’s like betraying Chandler.",25
Phoebe," (sees a little kid playing with a race car bed) (to kid) Hi. Y'know in

England this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, and

she makes the ‘that went right over your head’ motion) Woo!",45
Monica," (lying down on a mattress) Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this

is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.",23
Phoebe," Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler’s your friend...

(hops onto the bed) Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other

friends.",30
Joey," Good evening. I’m Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for

soap operas. Unfortunately, tonight will be my only class 

because due to a rare blood disease I only have two weeks to live. ",35
Joey, That was supposed to be an example of acting for soap operas.,12
Joey," I'm not! Look, why don't we get straight 

to the lesson! Ok, all right? Now um, on my first day as (proudly) Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our

Lives, (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.) I learned that one of

the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting

again, it means, you don’t have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like

this. (looks all intense for a moment and then gasps, the students cheer him) Thanks,

thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will

have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.",122
Joey," Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, ’Hey, the bell

doesn’t dismiss you, I dismiss you.’",20
Joey," Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.",12
Joey," Yeah, it’s this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I’m so,

so right for it, y'know, he’s just like me. Except he’s a boxer, and has an evil

twin.",30
Phoebe," Oh. (goes and answers the door and there is this huge black

delivery guy.) ",14
Phoebe," Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It’s

that bedroom there. (points to Monica’s room)",20
Phoebe," Yeah, so please, please, please, don’t say anything to Chandler.",10
Phoebe," Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let’s see what you got. All right ya,

put ‘em up. Come on. (they start shadow boxing)",23
Phoebe," Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young

men weren’t acting Christian enough.",22
Phoebe," Wow! And I’m a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I’m

sorry, we’ll put some ice on it. ",18
Phoebe," Oh, it’s the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.",10
Ross," There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah,

I never worked at one.",20
Ross," Yeah, if you’re really hungry. (Dr. Green stares at him) It was a

joke, I made a joke.",18
Ross," Wow. I’m sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. (Rachel

giggles at that)",18
Ross, Okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.),11
Ross," Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must’ve added

wrong. He only tipped like four percent.",19
Ross," That’s Daddy?! But doesn’t it bother you? You’re a

waitress.",10
Rachel," Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee

house, I’d be serving him sneezers.",21
Rachel," So. Ross, I’ve bugged him about this a million times, he’s not

gonna change.",14
Ross," The carbon, it’s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes,

the, the ah, night blindness.",18
Ross," Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too

much, way, way, too much, it’s a sickness really.",26
Rachel," Yeah it is, it is. (to Ross) We really, really have to do something

about that.",16
Rachel," Oh Daddy, no he didn’t mean anything by that, he really

didn’t.",12
Joey," Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I’ve never been able to cry as

an actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a

pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey that

I’ve just done something evil. That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my

eyebrow and I like it’ (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend

fishhook.) Okay, let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try

and divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And that’s how it’s done. Great soap

opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.",121
Joey," Awww, one of my students got an audition. I’m so proud.",11
Rachel," You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave it

alone.",13
Ross," Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there’s a bug in my

food.",15
Rachel," Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (Ross groans and

rubs his neck) Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.",24
Ross," Yeah, I’m gonna go to a doctor who went to a medical school in a mini-mall.",16
Phoebe," I’m, I’m freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something

and she shouldn’t have! All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to

ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?",40
Rachel," All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if

we act fast, okay. So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.",28
Ross," Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.",11
Rachel," Okay, look, Ross, I realize that my Father is difficult, but that’s

why you have got to be the bigger man here.",22
Ross," Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I

could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except

that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me! Like me tiny doctor!’",45
Rachel," Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For

me?",15
Ross," Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay

we’re never gonna get along.",18
Rachel," Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a

Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna

have to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry)",42
Phoebe," I know, you must’ve won like a contest or something! ",10
Phoebe," I’m sorry, okay, I-I wasn’t looking, and the store says that

they won’t take it back because you signed for it...",21
Phoebe," When I was you! Y'know what, it’s all Joey’s fault,

‘cause he left his nose open!",16
Monica," (to Phoebe) Quick, take off your dress, he won’t notice the bed.",12
Chandler," Hey, I’m going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the

bed) Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.",19
Phoebe," So. This has always been Monica’s bed, what you’re just

noticing now, how self-involved are you?",16
Chandler," Okay, well it this bed isn’t new, how come there is plastic on

the mattress?",15
Monica," Sometimes I have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and Phoebe offers

her, her hand to comfort her.)",18
Joey, Wow! That was good. That was...(points to his pocket) Tweezers?,10
Monica," Joey, the last time an actor did 

something this bad, a president died.  (Joey is confused)",16
Joey," Something happened at the tunnel? (Chandler gets a really 

frustrated look.)",11
Monica," Joey, you’re this guy’s teacher. I mean how could you do this?",12
Joey," Because, Monica, the guy’s so good, and I really, really want this

part.",13
Phoebe," Well, if you really, really want it, then it’s okay.",10
Ross," Dr. Green. How are you? (offers his hand, and Dr. Green puts his scarf on

it.)",16
Ross," (to Rachel) Okay, that’s it, I can’t take it anymore.",10
Rachel," What? What? He’s interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just

wants to know how you got here.",19
Ross," Oh, please. Sweetie it’s hopeless, okay, I’m just gonna go.

(starts to leave rubbing his neck)",16
Rachel," He’s got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my

chiropractor...",14
Rachel," Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.",10
Rachel, With my alignment. I’ve got one leg shorter than the other.,11
Rachel," What? It’s true, my right leg is two inches shorter.",10
Ross," What can I do, she doesn’t listen to me about renter’s insurance

either.",13
Ross, Okay. (to Rachel) Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?,16
Rachel," Yeah honey, I’m standing right there! Why didn’t you just tell

him about the mole I haven’t got checked yet.",20
Joey," (sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when you’ll

have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the

recent, present. And I’m ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to

play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned

out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he’s got a two

year contract opposite Susan Lucci, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me

I’m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on

TV. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from

his students.) Thank you.",132
Monica," Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I’m the lady that got stuck

with the racecar bed.",18
Joey," All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.",10
Joey," Oh-ho-kay, I’m talking to the king. (starts to go to a back room)",13
Chandler," Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screeching

sound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookin’! (honks the

bed’s little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops)

All right, I’ll leave. My bed’s so boring.",43
Rachel, Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies? ,13
Chandler, I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.),10
Chandler," All right I’ll have one. (he and Ross take another brownie,)",11
Ross," So what’s a matter, you need a dentist? I’ve got a good one.",13
Phoebe," No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can’t see him.",15
Chandler," See that is the problem with invisible dentists. 

Y'know, it's very unsettling to see all those metal tools 

just y'know.....flying around. ",21
Phoebe," Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.",10
Chandler," That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down

the hygienist’s blouse.",18
Phoebe," Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John,

my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend ‘Albino Bob’.",24
Phoebe," Yes, while I was in the chair! That’s why I take such good care of

my teeth now, y'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!",29
Ross," Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just happened

to die when you went to the dentist. It’s, it’s, it’s just ah, a

coincidence.",26
Phoebe," Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead.",10
Ross," Thanks, Gunther. (takes the plate Gunther serves him and Rachel comes up

and kisses him) (to Rachel) Hey! (to Gunther) Umm, can I get a napkin too?",27
Phoebe, (trying to bite into an apple) Ow! Ow! (drops the apple in disgust.),13
Rachel," Phoebe, you're in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.",13
Phoebe," All right, fine, fine, but if you’re my next victim, don’t

come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.",24
Ross," (patting his clothes like he is looking for his wallet) No, no he’s

not.",14
Ross," What? (to Joey) So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going

to tell Chandler?",20
Joey," Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to

not.",17
Rachel," Joey, you can’t keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you

have to tell him.",17
Joey," It’ll kill him. I mean it’ll, it’ll just kill him.",10
Phoebe," Well, you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist, maybe I’ll

kill him.",14
Joey," (looking out the window) Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock.

It’s like a Play-Doo Fat Factory. ",19
Phoebe," Well, I’m going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the

look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you,

or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all

that um...... (starts to cry and runs out)",58
Ross," Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids

messed up the Homo Sapien display.",23
Ross," Well, they painted over the word ‘Sapien’ for one thing, then

they rearranged the figures, let’s just leave it at that.",21
Monica," So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?",10
Ross," Yes, that’s what I was going to ask, thank you.",10
Ross," You? You! Want to watch Ben? (in the background Monica mouths

‘Don’t worry, I’ll be here the whole time.’ to Ross.) Yes! That’d

be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. (Monica

sarcastically mouths ‘Yeah!’ and holds up her thumb.)",49
Joey," If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact ‘Homo-sapien’, is that why

there extinct?",13
Rachel," (holding Ben) Look Benny, spoon. (moves it back and forth) Spoon. Come

on! All right, y'know what I think he’s bored.",21
Monica," Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show

Rachel? Come here. (takes Ben) We’re gonna do something fun. Okay. (throws Ben up in

the air a little bit and catches him) Weee!! (moves into the living room and does it

again) Weee!! (starts to walk back into the kitchen as she does it again, and hits

Ben’s head on that wooden beam across the ceiling.)",70
Monica," (to Ben) Who’s so brave, you’re so brave, yes you are,

you’re so brave.",14
Rachel," Okay. Okay honey, he’s fine, he’s fine, let’s just put

him down. Come here, Ben. (sets him on the couch) See that’s a good boy. (to Monica)

How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!",43
Monica," He’s not gonna say anything, because we’re not gonna tell him.",11
Rachel," So we’re okay, we’re okay, we’re okay, (starts to exam

Ben) aren’t we? No, we’re not okay, we’re not okay, there’s a bump,

there’s a bump.",26
Monica, Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!,10
Monica," The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to

your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, (high pitched) rweee!!",32
Rachel," Oh, oh, oh, I’ll get ‘Rainy Day Bear’!! (runs to get him)",12
Monica," Because he’ll know what to do? (Rachel comes out of her room with a

bear that’s dressed in a rain suit.) Oh my God, you’re a genius!",27
Chandler," Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are

nice?",16
Chandler," Janice’s birthday is coming up, I want to get her something

special. Come in here with me.",17
Joey," Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something

special, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.",26
Chandler," That’s a good idea, ‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba

birthday’. I would like to get her something serious.",18
Joey," Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get

her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.

And y'know she'll never get one for herself.",32
Chandler," All right. Look, I’m gonna go in here, and you don’t buy me

anything ever. (starts to go into the store)",21
Joey," (stopping him) No, no, you can’t, you can’t, okay, you

can’t, you can’t buy her pearls, you just can’t, you can’t, you

can’t.",23
Joey," Oh God. Uh, okay, here’s the thing, this is the thing, okay, the

thing is...",15
Joey," Okay. I went down to the ‘Mattress King’ showroom and, and I saw

Janice, kissing her ex-husband.",17
Chandler," Well she, she wouldn’t do that, she’s with, she’s with

me.",11
Joey," I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema

doesn’t sound so bad now, huh?",19
Phoebe, (running through the door) No! Oh! You’re alive! You’re alive!,10
Rachel," See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn’t I?",11
Phoebe," Yeah, well, we’ll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just

wanna call everyone I know.",18
Monica, Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?,12
Monica," Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It’s

no big deal, it’s not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See

watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. (goes over and starts hitting her head on the post) Ow, Monica

bang! (does it again) Everybody bang. (repeats) Ben bang. (repeats) Rachel bang. (repeats)

Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn’t that fun?",65
Rachel," (goes over and hits her head on the post) Look at that! (repeats) Look

at that! (repeats) We all do it. (repeats) Okay, I’m stopping now.",26
Rachel," Oh yeah! Y'know, if it’s not a headboard, it’s just not worth

it.",13
Chandler," Ah, I don’t know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me,

because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.",25
Chandler," You tell me! Maybe, it’s because I was just fooling with my ex!

Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!",19
Chandler," Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no

kissing!!",12
Chandler," I’ll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with

me? (Janice shakes her head no) Are you finished with him? (Janice shakes her head no) Do

you still love him? (Janice shakes her head yes) Do you still love me? (Janice shakes her

head yes) All right look, (grabs the bag) I’m gonna need an actual answer here okay,

so which is it, him or me? (his phone starts to ring)",75
Phoebe, (rushing in) Okay. If you’re alive you answer your phone!,10
Monica," Okay, Ben, I won’t tell your daddy that you had ice cream for

dinner, if you don’t tell about our little bonking incident.",23
Rachel," Monica, number one, I don’t think Ben understands the concept of

bribery, and number two, I... (Joey starts laughing in the background) (to Joey) What?!",25
Ross," (noticing the outfit he is wearing) What’d you do, take him whaling?",12
Ross," Oh my God, he just said your name, that’s great! Good job Ben.",13
Monica," Oh that’s right, that’s what I’d sound like if I

exploded.",11
Phoebe," Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is

alive.",14
Joey, Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the window and gasps.),13
Phoebe," Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting

stronger too, to bring down something that big.",23
Ross," And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn’t

moving.",15
Joey," Well, there is one way. His window’s open, I say, we poke him.",13
Joey," Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when

we get Chinese food?",19
Chandler," She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this

morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that

twelve pack of condoms. And now I can’t even return them, because she choked on the

receipt!",48
Joey," All right, you’re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it

was me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw another dart) I would ah, I

would bow out.",35
Chandler," What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joey

quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?",27
Joey," They have a kid together, y'know. They’re like, they’re like a

family, and if, I don’t know, there’s chance they could make that work, I know I

wouldn’t want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna

ah, come poke a nude guy?",52
Ross," Well, he’s finally asleep. About that ah, bump on his head?",11
Rachel," Are you, are you, are you sure it’s ah, a new bump? I mean, no

offense, I’ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.",27
Ross," It’s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time,

y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.",29
Ross, I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time.,12
Rachel," I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against

that thing!",15
Ross," Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet

song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’

and ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah, I don’t know, fell out of his head.",44
Ross," Oh, and also, he’s, he’s walkin’ kind of funny, his left

leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just sort of

y'know... (walks around in a circle) ",34
Monica," Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)",11
Monica," (coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!

(starts to chase Ross around the living room)",23
Ross, Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!,11
Chandler," Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me

get through it, because it’s, it’s, it’s not gonna be easy.",27
Chandler," I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be the guy

that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.

Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know ‘You’re the reason, you are

the reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy. And it didn’t matter

how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.",72
Chandler," No you don’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce

another chance. ",16
Chandler," I'll settle for half your heart! I'll settle for a quarter 

of your heart! I will settle for a little....a tiny...a ventricle. ",22
Chandler," I don’t care! (turns around and to the people watching them) I

don’t care!!",14
Joey," All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be

difficult to maneuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.",26
Ross," Can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!",13
Phoebe," I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is a

dead fat guy on a stick.",20
Joey," All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke. (they start to advance

the giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle.

Okay, okay, we’re approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their

view of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle. Thread the

needle. ",57
Joey," Hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!",12
Chandler," (singing) I’ll hold you close in my arms. (Phoebe

enters) I can’t resist your charms. And love....",17
Chandler," Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still

be allowed to fly this thing?",21
Rachel," Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?",10
Chandler," Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.",10
Ross, Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.,12
Ross," All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship

play. Power. (swings the racquet) Precision. (swings the racquet.) and panache. (does a

backswing and hits Sarah who’s started up the stairs, knocking her down, they both

watch in horror.)",41
Chandler," (reading the paper) Says here that a Muppet got whacked on 

Sesame

Street last night. (to Ross) Where exactly were around ten-ish?",22
Ross," Well, I’m gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do

you think she’ll like?",18
Chandler," Look out kids, he’s coming! (Ross continues to leave with his

head down in shame.)",15
Phoebe," Have fun. Oh wait, no, don’t! I forgot I am totally against that

now.",14
Phoebe," No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and

their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. (to Joey) Hey,

how do you sleep at night?",34
Joey," Well, I’m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey,

Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their

fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.",37
Chandler," Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of

them, it’s the only chance to see New York.",23
Rachel," Gunther, Gunther, please, I’ve worked here for two and a half

years, I know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)",24
Rachel," Huh. Well, y'know that’s actually a really good idea, because that

way they’ll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses

do that too.",29
Rachel," Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it

was a club they went to. Oh God, I’m, I’m sorry. (walks away)",27
Ross," So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that

you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell those

cookies anymore. ",35
Ross," Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?",11
Ross," I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the

way to India.",19
Ross," Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to

sell in order to win?",20
Ross," Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. (starts to get out his

wallet) How much are the boxes?",18
Ross," No, hi, I’m, I’m an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Bird

salute.)",13
Ross," Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I’m not invited to

sleep-overs.",15
Ross," No, please, please, um, it’s for a poor little girl who wants to go

to Space camp more than anything in the world.",23
Ross," Okay, okay! I’m going. I’m going. (goes across the hall to knock

on another door.)",15
Phoebe," Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realized duh,

all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh...",30
Joey," Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....",10
Phoebe," Okay. (One of Joey’s co-workers, walks by with a dead tree.) Yikes!

That one doesn’t look very fulfilled.",18
Joey," Oh, that’s, that’s ah, one of the old ones, he’s just

taking it to the back.",16
Phoebe," You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.",12
Joey, Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.,10
Phoebe," Why, do I have a feeling that’s not as happy as it sounds? (Joey

points out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to play

in the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face against

Joey’s shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)",57
Joey," (to the guy operating the chipper) Hey! Hey!! (makes the ‘cut

it’ motion with his hands)",16
Ross," ...and these come in the shapes of your favorite Christmas characters,

Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.",16
Joey," All right, I’ll take a box of the cream filled Jesuses.",11
Ross," Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I’m trying to send a little girl to

Space camp, I’m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?",28
Ross," No, but ah, there’s coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you

what, I’ll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.",24
Monica," All right, I’ll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and

that’s it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. (to Ross)

Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?",39
Ross," Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because

you ate them all. But ah, y'know I’m sure that’s not gonna happen this time, why

don’t I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the

Rudolph’s.",46
Ross," I’ll tell you what Mon, I’ll give you the first box for free.",13
Monica, (she reaches out for it and stops) Oh God! I gotta go! (runs out),14
Ross, Come on! All the cool kids are eating ‘em! (chases after her.),12
Rachel," (sitting down next to Chandler) I’m training to be better at a job

that I hate, my life officially sucks.",20
Joey," Look Rach, wasn’t this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you

wanted to do fashion stuff?",17
Chandler," How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out

resumes like what, two years ago?",17
Joey," If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you’ve got nothing

pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.",24
Chandler," He’s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go

after a job you really want.",19
Rachel," Well then how come you’re still at a job that you hate, I mean why

don’t you quit and get ‘the fear’?",22
Rachel," I don’t know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer,

y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don’t want to be 30 and still work here.",30
Chandler," Yeah, that’d be much worse than being 28, and still

working here.",12
Rachel," Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know

why I’m a terrible waitress? Because, I don’t care. I don’t care. I

don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the

tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do. So I don’t think

I should do it anymore. I’m gonna give you my weeks notice.",73
Chandler," (to Joey) Does this mean we’re gonna have to start paying for

coffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)",17
Monica," (comes up and starts looking through Ross’s cookie supply) Ross,

but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint

treasures?",27
Monica," No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it’s no big

deal, all right, I’m-I’m cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!",27
Ross," Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.",10
Rachel," (entering) Okay, stop what you’re doing, I need envelope stuffers,

I need stamp lickers.....",14
Chandler," Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad

co-captain only took up so much room.",19
Rachel," Hey-hey-hey that’s funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy!

You wanna know what else is really funny?!",18
Rachel," I don’t know, I don’t know, weren’t you the guy that told

me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!",30
Rachel," No, it’s not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I

don’t have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I’m just gonna, I’m just gonna call

Gunther and I’m gonna tell him, I’m not quitting.",37
Rachel," You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and

your fear.... ",18
Joey," What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?",10
Joey," Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have

an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?",31
Rachel," Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.",14
Joey," Only if you think it’s better than this... (holds up an aerosol can)

snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind

of Christmas lookie.",34
Joey," Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it’s a little more

money, but you get a nicer smell.",22
Phoebe," (running up carrying a tree) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you

don’t want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one. (points to the almost dead

tree she has)",33
Phoebe," Okay but that’s why you have to buy it, so it can fulfill it’s

Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey",27
Joey," Yeah, the ah, trees that don’t fulfill their Christmas destiny are

thrown in the chipper.",15
Joey," Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.",10
Monica," (entering) Hey, guys. I’m here to pick out my Christmas tree.",11
Phoebe," Well look no further, (shows her the dead one) this one’s yours!

Ahhh.",13
Monica, Is this the one that I threw out last year?,10
Phoebe," All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one!

I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to get so emotional, I guess it’s

just the holidays, it’s hard.",31
Monica," Oh honey, is that ‘cause your Mom died around Christmas?",10
Monica," Oh. (turns and looks at Joey, who gives a ‘way-to-go’ thumbs

up and smile.)",14
Ross," (to the girl sitting next to him) Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you

sell?",17
Ross, I don’t have too. I can just look at you.,10
Ross," That’s crap!! Sister Brown Bird. (to Elizabeth) Good going. (does the

salute)",12
Ross," Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious....

nougat.... diffiency. ",15
Ross," Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old

sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.",27
Rachel," Oh, I blew it. I wouldn’t of even hired me.",10
Ross," Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you’re gonna go on like a thousand

interviews before you get a job. (she glares at him) That’s not how that was supposed

to come out.",31
Chandler," Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the

coffee house.",14
Rachel," I can’t! It’s too late! Terry already hired that girl over

there. (points to her) Look at her, she’s even got waitress experience. Last night

she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... (starts to cry) swans.",37
Chandler," Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my

Christmas.",12
Phoebe," You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you’re the best!",10
Rachel," (answering the phone) Hello? (listens) Yeah, this is she. (listens) Oh!

You’re kidding! You’re kidding! (listens) Oh thank you! I love you!",22
Rachel," Here we go. I’m serving my last cup of coffee. (the gang starts

humming the graduation theme) There you go. (hands it to Chandler) Enjoy. (they all cheer)",28
Rachel," Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I

ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it’s

just time to move on. (at the counter Gunther starts to cry and runs into the back room)

Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it

feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.",82
Ross," I’m, I’m sorry you didn’t get to go to Space camp, and

I’m hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah

Tuttle’s Private Very Special Space camp!! (opens the door and Chandler and Joey jump

up, their apartment is decorated like outer space, one of the leather chairs is covered in

tinfoil.)",56
Ross," Oh come on! Here we go! (picks her up and puts her in the chair) Stand by

for mission countdown!",20
Joey," (simulating an echo) Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine....,

eight, eight, eight... (Chandler hits him in the back of the head) Okay, Blast off!",23
Ross," Oh no! An asteroid! (throws the soccer ball off the back of Joey’s

head.)",14
Joey," Okay, pick a card, any card. (Monica picks one) All right, now memorize

it. Show to everybody. Got it?",19
Joey," All right, give it back to me. (takes the card back, but he looks at the

card before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks a

little while) 5 of hearts.",40
Monica," He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.",11
Phoebe," Why don’t you go up there and ask him to ‘step lightly,

please?’",13
Monica," I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there

to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.",26
Phoebe," Ooh, that is silly. (gets up) I’ll go up there, I’ll tell him

to keep it down.",17
Joey," All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna

know how I did it, I’ll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you

didn’t see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. (picks

up a card and quickly looks at it) I just did it. (does it again) I just did it, again.

Here, I’ll slow it down so that you guys can see it. (looks and the card in slow

motion)",87
Phoebe," (muffled through the floor) Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs

and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... (I tired but the

rest is unintelligible).",34
Chandler," (entering) Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with

a little noose at the end?",19
Chandler," Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she

looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid’s pretzel at them.",25
Joey," Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke

up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed

me.",31
Chandler," Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.",13
Joey," Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....",10
Ross," Hey Chandler, there’s a party tomorrow, you’ll feel better then.",10
Chandler," Oh, y'know what, I’m gonna be okay, you don’t have to throw

a party for me.",16
Chandler," Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.",13
Chandler," Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it’s

supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.",16
Rachel," (jumping up from reading her magazine) Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.",11
Rachel," Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.",11
Rachel," Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.",16
Rachel," Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think

why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely

related to the field they’re interested in.",38
Monica," (gives her a look) Gee, I don’t know Rach. Order up!! I got a

Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!",25
Rachel," Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t.... I don’t mind

paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira,

the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.",34
Rachel," Oh well then, so I’m just going to go back to talking to my friend

here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.",26
Monica," Actually that's a Barbara Streisandwich. 

(Rachel looks at her) What? I named that one.",14
Rachel, (looks at Monica) (to him) Do you want my pickle?,10
Monica," Hey Gunther. Hi. (to Phoebe) I mean you’re going out on a date with

the noisy guy upstairs?",18
Monica," I know, he’s too charming, but if you two start going out, then

it’s just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.",26
Joey," I don’t know, Chandler is supposed to be passin’ ‘em

around...",11
Joey, Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.,15
Rachel," (entering, to Ross) The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.",11
Rachel," Hi! So I’m out having lunch at Monica’s and this guy starts

talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale’s and

there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and

he’s gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!",59
Ross," What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?",11
Ross, Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.,10
Ross," Well, I’m just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop

in out of nowhere for no reason.",20
Ross," Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?",12
Ross," Thank you. (to Rachel) So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about

me?",15
Rachel," I didn’t have to, because I was wearing my ‘I heart Ross’

sandwich board and ringing my bell.",18
Chandler," (to Monica) Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?",11
Monica," How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey’s sisters.",10
Phoebe," Wow. Okay, I don’t know how to talk to you.",10
Chandler," No-no-no-no, no, it’s a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily

anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can’t we savor the precious moments? (to

one of Joey’s sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have.",38
Ross," Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.",15
Ross," Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good

guy.",15
Monica," Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I

actually used the phrase, ‘Hummina-hummina-hummina.’ (walks away)",23
Ross," (to Rachel) So, he’s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark

doesn’t want anything in exchange for helping him?",21
Rachel," Well, I assume I’ll have to take showers with him, but y'know,

that’s true of any job.",17
Chandler," Well, my apartment isn’t there anymore, because I drank it.",10
Phoebe," Where’d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the

presents.",14
Chandler," Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.",11
Chandler," Ah, I fooled around with Joey’s sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well,

that’s not the worst part. ",15
Ross," (to Rachel) You see what men do! Don’t tell me men are not nice!

(points to Chandler) This is men!!",20
Monica," Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he’s actually

going to kill you dead.",18
Chandler," (to Monica) You see you can’t tell which one is which either,

dwha!!",13
Phoebe, We didn’t fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!,10
Chandler," Veronica. Look, it’s got to be Veronica, the girl in the red

skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.",21
Chandler," Look, when I’ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly

friendly, and I’m sorry.",15
Joey," (angrily entering, to Chandler) Can I talk to you for a second?!",12
Joey," Why don’t you ask Chandler, ‘cause he’s the one that fooled

around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that

true? Or are you just gettin’ over Janice by groping my sister. ",40
Joey," Really? That’s great! You and my sister, sittin’ in a tree.",11
Monica," No honey, I’m sorry, but the weekend’s not over yet.",10
Rachel," Oh. (we hear laughing from the upstairs apartment) Oh my God, is that

Phoebe?",14
Ross," Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How’s it going. This is the hardest letter

I’ve ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hell’s a matter with you? How do

you think Joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a

letter?",46
Chandler," Well, that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France.

When actually I’ll be in Cuba.",19
Ross," All right, look, look, you’ve got to do this yourself, okay in

person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela,

okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her

down easy.",52
Chandler, What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?,12
Joey, Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?,11
Joey," You are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) Now look,

listen, listen, you got to be cool, ‘cause my Grandma doesn’t know about you two

yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on

Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.",53
Rachel," I can’t believe Mark didn’t call. It’s Sunday night, and

he didn’t call.",13
Rachel," (to Ross) Yeah, right. Look at you, you’re practically giddy.",10
Ross," No, I’m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn’t work out. Look,

Rach, I want only good things for you.",19
Monica," Wait a minute, why don’t you just call Mark. (they both look up in

shock) I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you’ve got to make

stuff happen.",34
Monica," (to Ross) Honey, it’s not pushy, he gave her his home number.",12
Ross," (to Rachel, as she gets his number) What, he gave you his home number? As

in like, to, to his home?",21
Rachel," Yeah, and you don’t mind if I call, because you only want good

things for me.",16
Ross," That’s right good things, that-that is what I said. (glances at

Monica)",12
Rachel," (on phone) Hello, Mark? Hi, it’s Rachel Green. (listens) Oh no,

don’t you apologize. (listens) Yeah, I’ll hold. (to Monica and Ross) He left my

number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.",40
Rachel," (on phone) Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it’s perfect. Oh

God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! (hangs up phone) I got the interview!",26
Rachel, He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.,14
Ross," Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I’d expect nothing less.",15
Rachel, I got to figure out what I’m going to wear.,10
Rachel," Yeah! Right! Okay, I’ll see you guys later. (starts to leave) Woo

hoo!",13
Ross," You go get ‘em. (to Monica) What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in

some way?",19
Ross," ‘Why don’t you call him?!’ Well, thank you very much!

Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically

remove the boyfriend!",32
Ross," Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy

is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.",26
Monica," What?! Ross y'know this isn’t even about you! I mean this is about

Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you’re

right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?",42
Chandler," This tiramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?",10
Chandler," Well, it’s, it’s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?",10
Chandler," Would you just please....give me the recipe ‘cause this is

great. It’s top notch.",14
Chandler, Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn’t mean anything.,10
Chandler, Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall),12
Chandler," Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he

ducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and I’m not really in

a, in a commitment kind of place.",40
Chandler," This is so bad. If-if you’re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?",11
Chandler, (pats him on the shoulder) You’re it! Now run and hide!,11
Joey," What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?",13
Chandler," I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey’s

sisters gasp) Look, I’m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really

similar.",26
Chandler," Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother’s not

going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?",19
Joey," Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you’d

be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!",26
Joey," Hey, Nonna, why don't you go into the den? I think 

Cops is on.",14
Chandler," Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want

you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best

friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.",41
Joey," No! No! No! No, I’m not going to punch Chandler.",10
Joey," No you won’t. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe

him, he’s sorry. But, (to Chandler) you’ve got one more apology to make, all

right, you’ve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.",35
Chandler," You’ve got it. (he starts to look at his sister’s, but he

still doesn’t know which one is Mary-Angela.)",19
Ross," Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... (gives her a flower)

",15
Rachel," Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank

God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy

and wouldn’t shut up.",34
Ross," Listen, I’m ah, I’m sorry I’ve been so crazy and jealous

and, it’s just that I like you a lot, so...",21
Rachel," (to Ross) Oh my God!! (she turns around and hugs Mark, not Ross)",13
Phoebe," Oh, I’m sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really

happens to like me.",18
Ross, Maybe he’s just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?,11
Joey," All right, that’s it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. (gets up) This guy

is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! (stops and turns around and asks Rachel)

But, is he a big guy?",37
Ross," Ah, we’ll all go. (motions to Chandler) Come on. (the guys 

leave)",12
Chandler," Well, let's see...I just got beat up 

by a girl. (thinks about it) They need me. (leaves with the other two)",21
Monica," Y'know if it’s any consolation, he really did sound like he was

having more fun with you. (Rachel nods in agreement)",21
Rachel," (running in from her bedroom, wearing only a towel) Okay. Hey. Umm. Does

everybody hate these shoes? ",17
Chandler," Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that

as long as your wearing that towel dress. ",21
Ross," (to Chandler) It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to

start with her! ",17
Chandler," All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?

",15
Chandler," I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert,

y'know he's the botanist. ",18
Phoebe," (entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) Morning. Rach,

I'm here with the purses! ",16
Chandler, (to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys. ,11
Rachel," (running into the living room) Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs. ",12
Phoebe," Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles. ",10
Rachel," No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today. ",12
Ross," Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down

there and I'll take you out to lunch? ",22
Ross," Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job? ",13
Rachel," Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. (to

Phoebe) Is this actually a lunchbox? ",21
Phoebe," Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it. ",11
Chandler," (to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday? ",10
Ross," What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again? ",14
Chandler," Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the

bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can

see a stripper. ",30
Phoebe," A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so cliché. Why don't you get a

magician?! ",16
Chandler," Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all

right. ",15
Ross," She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should

of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, (to Joey) he's really

good looking. (Joey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up) What am I gonna do? ",45
Chandler," Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings!

(pause) Don't cry out loud. ",17
Joey," (hanging up the phone) Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway

musical? ",14
Chandler," I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer. ",13
Joey," It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think

I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.

",32
Ross," Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities. ",11
Rachel, Oh!! I love this job! (her phone rings) Wow! My first call. ,12
Ross," Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in

his own office? ",16
Rachel," Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two

assistants. ",14
Ross," Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she? ",11
Rachel," I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go.

(to Mark) Mark, I need you! ",20
Ross," Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing

another number. (hangs up) ",19
Monica," Have I read it? (pause) No, are you enjoying it? ",10
Monica," You're a poet and don't know it. (she turns away and makes a face like 'I

can't believe I just said that.') ",22
Monica," Oh, then you do know it. (pause) So um what kind of things do you write

about? ",17
Monica," How would that go? (they kiss) Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it. ",14
Joey," (singing) You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, (picks a

handkerchief from the pianist's pocket) you've got to pick a pocket or two.......... ",25
Joey," Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part. ",11
Chandler," ....three years of modern dance with Twyla Tharp! Five years with the

American Ballet Theater?! ",15
Joey," Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids

either. ",15
Joey," Yeah, I can dance, y'know. (starts to dance really, really, really badly) ",12
Chandler," All right, I have to get that, but no-no. (answering phone) Hello?

(listens) (happily) Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that

you do that. (listens) Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred?

(listens) So would I, would I have to provide the grapes? ",58
Monica," It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even

sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to

write a poem. ",35
Joey, Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me. ,10
Joey," Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be? ",17
Monica," Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am

like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.

(hands them the poem) ",36
Monica," Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.

(tries to take the poem) ",21
Monica," All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys. ",14
Phoebe," What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, (reading) 'My

vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.'

He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase! ""Voz""? 

Vase?",40
Phoebe," Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too. ",10
Rachel," Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm... (she picks up this bug and it starts to play

the theme from Love Story) ",20
Rachel," Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's

just really romantic. ",17
Ross," I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you

any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt! ",27
Ross," ...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office

anymorrrrre!! ",13
Rachel," Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your

territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk! ",31
Rachel," Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He

said this is what you guys do. ",22
Ross," Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot. ",12
Chandler," Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her

right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to

complain about you. ",31
Joey," Yeah, I tried taking a dance class today to get ready for this 

callback tomorrow.",15
Ross,"  Good 

work. Can we get back to the Mark thing? What am I going to do? ",16
Chandler," Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did

that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few

surprise visits. ",33
Chandler," All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us,

meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she

starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.' ",42
Joey," And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And

he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be

like, (sadly) 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And

we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!' ",58
Rachel, Ohhh! That is soo sweet! (gets up to get herself a cup of coffee) ,14
Ross, What's going on?! (throws the love bug at him) That's what's going on!! ,13
Ross," I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie!

What do I have to do to get some service?! (turns to Rachel) Hi Rach. (He's puts his hand

on her shoulder and she knocks it away.) ",42
Phoebe," Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. (hugs her)

",13
Monica," Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't

write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.

And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine

comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not

mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no

right to make that kind of judgment about me. ",87
Joey," I know, it was the best I could get out of them. ",12
Rachel," So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night? ",12
Chandler," Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. (holds up a pen) See,

she's fully dressed, right? ",20
Chandler," And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you

click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street,

she's window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked! (Rachel just

stares at him.) ",43
Chandler," Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen. ",12
Ross," (sits down next to her) I'm sorry, I was an idiot. ",11
Ross," A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda

hard for me. ",18
Rachel," Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?

",15
Ross," Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if

it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not

gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away. ",47
Rachel," Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people

love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. (she

kisses him) ",33
Chandler," Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you

pick me up some porn? ",18
Ross," Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon. ",15
Ross," Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party. ",12
Chandler," Man, I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing) ",13
Ross," Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did 

her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking 

them to a gymboree

class. Why, is that okay? ",36
Rachel, Oh. (starts shaking the sugar down in a packet really hard.) ,11
Rachel," Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I

mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own? ",29
Rachel," I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain

things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I... ",21
Rachel," (to Chandler) Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of

hours, y'know. ",16
Chandler," Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him 

off to a stripper. ",16
Rachel," (runs out of the coffee house) All 

right, I'm jealous! Ross! I'm jealous!",13
Chandler," (just lays there looking at his pen 

impersonating the woman's voice) Oh no no Chandler please don't. Oh no no no no 

I beg of you to not...! Oh! (clicks the pen so she is naked and he laughs)

 ",39
Monica, Six? I just had it for one night. It’s three.,10
Monica," Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you’re gonna

have to help me out here, ‘cause I only have three.",24
Monica," Wow! Your lip went bald. (Richard pays the clerk) Hey, thanks.",11
Monica," (removes them) That’s because I-I was just grabbing some things out

of the dryer, and it’s static cling. Or maybe it’s just that God knew I’d

be running into you and saw an opportunity.",34
Monica," You see that guy? He’s in classics now, but y'know as soon as we

leave he’s going straight to the porn.",21
Monica," Yeah, we're not judging. (the customer goes to the adult 

section) ",11
Monica," Oh, um, I don’t know if that’s a good idea.",10
Rachel," (looking at her watch) Oh my God, I gotta go to work!",12
Ross," Oh sweetie, when do you think you’re going to get off tonight?",12
Rachel, Oh I don’t know honey. It’s gonna be really late.,10
Rachel," I know. I’m sorry. Look, I’ll make a deal with you all right?

Okay?",14
Rachel, For every night that you’re asleep before I get home from work...,12
Rachel, I will wake you up in a way that’s proved very popular in the past.,15
Ross," Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.",14
Joey, (to Phoebe) Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?,11
Phoebe," Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like

y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that’s he’s

going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.",39
Chandler," Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now

she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.",22
Monica," It’s not a date, okay. I’m just gonna teach him how to make

lasagna for some pot luck dinner he has.",21
Joey," Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you’ll probably be

hungry after the sex.",16
Monica," We’re not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing’s changed here. He

still doesn’t want children and I still do, so that’s why we’re just gonna

be friends.",26
Joey," Check the freezer. If there’s none in there, then we’re probably

out. Are you just getting in from work? It’s late.",21
Rachel," Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the

meeting with the reps from Calvin Klein. I told my boss I liked this line of

lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?",43
Joey, I discovered I’m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.,14
Rachel," Hmm. (she opens the freezer) Umm, why do you have a copy of The

Shining in your freezer?",18
Joey," Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.",12
Rachel," But ah, you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer?",11
Joey," Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining,

without making sure we’ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.",23
Joey, Haven’t you ever read the same book over and over again?,11
Rachel," Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean

that’s a classic, what’s so great about The Shining?",23
Rachel," Okay. Ah, well we’ll just see about that, okay. I will read The

Shining, (she tries to take the book away from him but he doesn’t want to let it

go) and you will read Little Women. ",37
Joey," How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?",11
Chandler," (touching the couch) I love this 

fabric. I think I'm going to have a suit made out of this. (Ross just stares at 

him.)",24
Phoebe," (to Robert) You’ve have lipstick right here (points to her cheek).

That’s okay, it’s mine, we just kissed.",18
Chandler," (to Robert) So ah, isn’t a bit cold out for shorts?",11
Chandler," (standing up) I’m up! I’m up, I’ve gotten up now!

Anybody ah, want anything?",14
Ross," Okay. (goes over to the counter) (to Chandler) What ah, what is the matter

with you? What’s going on?",19
Ross," No, no, that won’t be ah, that won’t be necessary (leans down

and looks up Robert’s shorts, seeing Robert’s package.) ",20
Ross," Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.",12
Monica," You say ‘Thank you very much,’ and then you buy me something

pretty. Come on, we’re gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we’re gonna start

squishing the tomatoes.",30
Monica, You touch people’s eyeballs every day and this feels weird.,10
Monica," Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it (does so) 

and it should umm....do the trick.. ",20
Joey," Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo’s manuscript. I don’t see how he

could ever forgive her.",16
Joey," But Jo’s got a crush on Laurie. (Ross nods his head) Oh. You mean

it’s like a girl-girl thing? ‘Cause that is the one thing missing from The

Shining.",29
Joey, No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.,10
Phoebe," Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a

twenty-three pointer.",16
Joey," (noticing Chandler) What are you doing? (he pushes Chandler back to his

side of the couch) Get back over on your side of the... (sees Robert in all his glory)

Hello!! (to Robert) Hi, I’m Joey, we haven’t met.",39
Phoebe," What? (the guys keep laughing.) What? You guys, what is going on? You

not like Robert? (the guys keep laughing.) Why are you laughing?!",24
Chandler," I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it just seems that Robert isn’t

as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.",22
Joey," Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?",10
Monica," So, how’d the lasagna go over? (listens) Really?! Good. 

So you owe me three pretty things. (listens) Yeah, I’ve been thinking a lot 

about you too. (listens) I know. It’s hard this whole platonomy thing. (listens) It’s a word!",39
Monica," Yeah, I do think it’s better this way. (listens) Yeah, we’re

being smart. (gets up to answer the door) (listens) Yes, I’m sure.(she opens the door

and it’s Richard)",29
Monica," Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you

currently have any other racquetball buddies?",21
Monica," ‘Cause if you do that means you’d be canceling it for me, and

we’re just friends.",16
Monica," And besides you know what? It wouldn't 

be fair anyways because my mother is trying to set me up with some lawyer. ",22
Monica," Oh, no she doesn't actually have one. But she's looking.",10
Chandler," Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I

were you I would wear them every day, every day!",23
Phoebe," That’s all right, that’s well, I figured.... (they start to

leave as Joey enters.)",14
Joey," Oooh, the next part’s the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...",13
Joey," All right I’ll talk in code. (to Ross and Chandler) Remember when the

kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?",21
Joey," Oh, all blank, and no blank, make’s blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no,

no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they

get away. Aww!",34
Rachel," All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though

she’s still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.",26
Joey," Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the

hotel, and kills the dad.",18
Joey, Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?,11
Chandler," No, Beth doesn’t die, she doesn’t die. Does she Rachel?",10
Ross," Joey’s asking if you’ve just ruined the first book he’s

ever loved that didn’t star Jack Nicholson?",17
Rachel," (screams and grabs a potato masher to defend herself) Sorry. I’m

sorry.",12
Monica," You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top

it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, (opens her coat revealing a large burn mark over her

left breast.) in a grill fire.",41
Rachel," I’m sorry, I was just thinking you’re day could still pick up.",12
Phoebe," Listen, Robert’s gonna be here any second so, will one of you just

tell him?",15
Phoebe," Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is it

on the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’",20
Chandler," We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know

and talk about his.... stuff. ",19
Ross," He’s right, even if it’s to say something complementary. (He

stops and thinks about what he just said.) ",18
Chandler," Why don't you just tell him? You're 

going out with him. ",11
Phoebe," Oh no, it'd be way too awkward. No. I haven't even seen it 

with permission yet. So..so what do I do?  Just, you know, break up with 

him?",28
Ross, I don't know. I think this is an unsolvable problem.,10
Chandler," It's a curiat mariah. (Ross looks confused.) The 

unsolvable problem they gave to Captain Kirk as part of his training to be a 

starfleet commander. ",25
Ross," It's the place with the cheap rooms where we stayed at in 

Israel.",13
Monica," Oh my God! Oh my God! (She frantically tries to clean up the bedroom as

Richard starts the tour.)",19
Monica," (still hiding under the blankets) So um, who was she?",10
Monica," (still hiding under the blankets) Did you like her? And I’m just

asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.",23
Monica," (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I’m not fine, I’m not. I mean how

can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... (pause)

Y'know what, what if we’re friends who don’t see other people?",41
Monica," Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so

terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood

up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.",43
Monica," Y'know what, I’ve got to walk out of here right now, ‘cause

getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don’t think I

could do it again.",34
Joey," Jo’s there, but I don’t think there’s anything she could

do.",11
Rachel, Do you want to put the book in the freezer?,10
Phoebe," Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that

before.",14
Phoebe," (to Chandler) Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at

the same time?",17
Chandler," Well, that’s pretty much all I’m looking for from these

people.",11
Ross," Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know,

she’s more..(shakes his shoulders, like he’s dancing) y'know, and you’re

more (sees the look from Phoebe and stops)",29
Phoebe," Oh no, one of those ‘look for the hidden meaning’ songs.",11
Chandler," (to Ross) All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the

place with the big fish comes up again. I’d like know whether that’s several big

fish or just one big fish.",36
Joey," (to Leslie) So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.",10
Phoebe," Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once

you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y’know. Very cold, hard, unyielding,

y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. (to Monica) Can I have a

tissue, please?",46
Chandler," No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called

‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’",24
Chandler," Jeez, man did you fall..(sees it’s a beautiful woman coming out

of the men’s room) Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?",24
Chandler," (to Gunther) Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I’m-I’m

talking to ah, (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) This is the part where you say

your name.",32
Chandler," Nope, nope, I’d just ah, I’d rather talk to you. (pause)

Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)",27
Joey," Ah, he can’t make it, he said he had to his... (sees Ginger) Whoa-oh!

(hides behind the coat rack.)",19
Rachel," I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.",17
Ross," Come on sweetie! You’ve had to work late every night for the past two

weeks, what is it this time?",20
Ross," (to Rachel) But work comes first! (to Mark) Oh hey, but that’s sad

about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?",25
Ross," Oh well that’s great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then.

Huh? (picks a pad up off Rachel’s desk and tosses it into his box) Good bye.",31
Phoebe," Oh. (takes her beeper puts in a pot, covers it, and puts the pot in the

oven)",17
Phoebe," Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together.

That’s the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!",23
Phoebe," Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our

Moms worked on the barge together.",19
Monica," Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.",13
Monica," No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.",10
Joey," Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn’t something that sounded like

Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?",17
Monica," No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said,

(singing) ‘the movie star.’",17
Joey," Aww, man. That’s the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out

he’s my roommate, she’s gonna tell him what I did.",23
Joey," What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can’t, I can’t tell you that,

it’s like the most awful, horrible thing I’ve ever done my whole life.",26
Phoebe," (sarcastically) Woah! You're really not 

making us want to hear it less.",12
Monica," Y'know what, don’t tell us. We’ll just wait until Chandler

gets home, (to Phoebe) because it’ll be more fun that way.",21
Joey," All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone

out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad’s cabin. Just me,

her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic

dinner....",49
Joey," I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of

the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out.

So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.",55
Joey," I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should’ve told you

about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.",23
Monica," Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?",13
Chandler," Well, that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’ve

ever met in a men’s room.",16
Chandler," (sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in

a puddle.",18
Chandler," Yeah, we’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.",11
Chandler," You’re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?",12
Ross," Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today.

Umm, Mark, Mark saying ‘I’ll see you Saturday.’",21
Rachel," Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you

didn’t mind.",15
Ross," Oh, no, no, no, it’s-it’s not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....",12
Rachel," Oh, please tell me it’s not because I’m going with Mark.",11
Ross," Well, I’m sorry, but ah, look if you’re not working with him

anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?",23
Ross," Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...",10
Rachel," Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with

Mark?",15
Rachel," I don’t know, you thought ‘See you Saturday’ was funny.

Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff

with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.",41
Ross," Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you

know I could be a fashion..... monger.",23
Rachel," Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. (Ross has a worried

look on his face) What?",20
Phoebe," It’s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn’t

called. Not that I even care, y'know.",18
Monica, Phoebe why don’t you just call her? You obviously want to.,11
Phoebe," I can’t. I can’t. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her

and then one day it was ‘Okay, bye Pheebs’ gone. Y'know what the saddest part

is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in like

all my lives.",48
Ross," (to Rachel) I’m really glad we came. (Rachel smiles and rubs his arm)

You’re so pretty. I love you.",19
Phoebe," (singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat,

smelly cat, it’s not your fault.",18
Phoebe," Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I’d be a millionaire by

now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.",28
Phoebe," That’s okay. All right, I’m gonna play song that’s

really, really sad. It’s called Magician Box Mix Up. (she turns her guitar upside

down to play it.)",27
Monica," Oh, can I borrow this? (points to his milk) My milk’s gone bad.",13
Chandler," Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.",16
Chandler," Great. It was great. She’s ah, she’s great, great looking,

great personality, she’s greatness.",14
Monica," Sounds like she’s got the ah, whole package. 

So she's got it all, huh? She's the real deal?",18
Chandler," Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn’t have, but it

did. I mean I like her, I don’t want to stop seeing her, but every so often it’s

like ‘Hey, y'know what, where’s your leg?’ I mean I’m the smallest

person in the world aren’t I? I’m the smallest person in the world.",57
Chandler, (to Monica) Actually he’s the smallest person in the world.,10
Joey," Listen, I ah, I know it’s a long shot. But, by any chance did she find

that funny?",18
Rachel," Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father’s boat didn’t

make that much noise when it hit rocks!",18
Ross," Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about

strappy backed dresses.",13
Rachel," Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium

listening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thing

that’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone we

didn’t know it had!’",39
Ross," First of all it’s Professor Pitain! And second of all, that little

bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn’t fly.",23
Ross," Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I

wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.",27
Ross," No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. (Makes an

unusual sound, then he realizes that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shake

it off, thinking it’s alive and attacking him.)",39
Rachel," Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with

me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?",29
Ross," No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don’t know, I feel like lately, I

feel like you’re slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new

people, and you’ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it’s dumb, but

I hate that I’m not a part of it.",56
Rachel," It’s not dumb. But, maybe it’s okay that you’re not a

part of it. Y'know what I mean? (Ross looks confused) I mean it’s like, I-I-I like

that you’re not involved in that part of my life.",37
Rachel," Honey see, it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because I

do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me y'know,

I’m out there, on my own, and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it,

because it’s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?",55
Chandler," No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?",12
Chandler," Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as...

(starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) Ahh, what?",22
Chandler," You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?",11
Phoebe," (to Leslie) Oh, I thought you weren’t coming. What? Where were you?",12
Phoebe," Okay, don’t give me a reason to get mad, okay",10
Phoebe," No, look, I told you that I didn’t want you to try and sell it, and

you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably

would’ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I

can’t trust you then just forget it. ",58
Phoebe," Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important

thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but

we won’t be partners. So what’s it gonna be?",41
Phoebe," Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life’s gonna had you all

kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a

new song?",29
Phoebe," Okay. (singing) ‘Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle

whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.’ That’s all I have so far.",27
Chandler," Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no

waiting.",13
Monica," Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!",13
Chandler," That was an obvious joke, and I didn’t think of it.

Why didn’t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!",30
Joey," (to Monica) Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of

olives?",16
Monica," I won’t give you anything, but you’ll owe me 2.95.",10
Phoebe, (entering) Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!,10
Monica, Why? (in a mother-like tone) Do you have a report due?,11
Phoebe," I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages

outside the UN and, I don’t know where his country is.",26
Monica," Okay, let’s start with the free messages outside the UN.",10
Phoebe," Oh!! That’s my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.",12
Monica," Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what

country is this guy from?",18
Phoebe," Umm, well he’s very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very

sophisticated, and he doesn’t speak any English, but according to his translator, he

totally gets me.",26
Monica," ‘Kay, here you go. (Hands her this tiny little globe.)",10
Joey," (with olives on each of his right hand 

fingers) People of Earth, surrender! (Monica and Phoebe look at him puzzled.) 

Giant alien. Five tiny heads. (wiggles his fingers) (both still just stare at 

him)",34
Chandler," (entering) Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I’m going down

to the Xerox place.",14
Chandler," Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.",11
Monica," Well, if you don’t have anything to copy, why are you going down

there?",14
Joey," Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the

belly button ring again?",19
Chandler," Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come

on Chloe!!",15
Joey," Uh, y'know what, we’re having second thoughts about our copying

needs. And we’ll need a little more time to think about it.",22
Chandler," All right, rock on. (Does the ‘Hang 10’ sign, then hides his

face in shame.)",15
Phoebe," Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that’s dumb what I

said, don’t tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. (Mischa does so and

Sergei kisses her hand.) Nice, (to Mischa) thank you. This is me. Here.",43
Phoebe," (to Mischa) Thank you, very much! Oh! (to Sergei) Thank you!",11
Phoebe," (to Mischa) Okay, y'know what, you don’t have to do that now.

(Mischa translates that to Sergei) No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don’t! (Mischa tells

Sergei he can proceed and steps away) Well the moment’s over.",35
Phoebe, (pointing to the globe) See there it is right there.,10
Phoebe," Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way

across it.",17
Phoebe," Yeah. Except for, y'know when you’re on a date and you’re

getting along really great but the guy’s translator keeps getting in the way.",24
Monica," Oh no, she’s still at work, but she told me to tell you to call

her.",16
Ross," Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this?

Doesn’t she know it’s our anniversary?",20
Monica," All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject.

(holds up a notepad) Call Rachel.",20
Monica," Oh that’s my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. (to Phoebe)

She’s fancy.",15
Ross," (nervously) Oh, yeah? What happened? Someone scare you? Make you 

laugh too hard?",13
Rachel," Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I’ve got to get this

order in. Honey, I’m so sorry, but it looks like I’m gonna be here all night.",29
Ross," What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?",12
Rachel," No-no-no, no, honey please, I’ve got, I’ve just have so much

to deal with.",14
Phoebe," (to Monica) Anyway, I’m going out with Sergei again tonight, and

um, could you come and be the translator’s date? So that when we, it’s time for

our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he’s really, he’s kinda cute.",41
Monica," Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your

friend Spackle Back Larry?",17
Phoebe," Hey, don’t call him that! His name is Spackle Back Harry!",11
Chandler," Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did

Chloe say we should be there?",19
Joey," Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?",14
Chandler," Yeah, I-I-I think so. (Pauses and thinks about it for a second) Yeah,

I-I think so...",16
Joey," God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?",12
Chandler," She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up

with a set of ground rules.",19
Joey," Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your

eyes. Y'know, because you don’t want to be doing something and then look up and see

something you don’t want to be seeing.",37
Chandler," Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are

closed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab

something with his hand.)",34
Joey," Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we...

(clears throat) y'know each would, (clears throat again) y'know (pause) be?",26
Chandler," Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.",10
Joey," Yeah, I guess, but what’s like heads and what’s tails?",10
Chandler," Well it you don’t know that, then I don’t want to do this

with you.",15
Rachel," (on the phone) No, no, no, I’m looking at a purchase order right

here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and

colours. And.... (listens) What does it matter, what I’m wearing?! Can I please speak

to your supervisor? (listens) Thank you. (to Sophie) We’re holding.",54
Ross," Well you said you couldn’t go out so.... (pulls the cover off of the

basket)",15
Rachel," Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.",12
Rachel," Honey, honey, I’m sorry, I know it’s our anniversary but I

told you on the phone I don’t have time to stop.",22
Ross," Okay, you don’t have to stop, I’m invisible, I’m not here.

(lights a candle)",14
Rachel," But I don’t, hmm... (on phone) Oh, who approved that order?!

(listens) Well there is no Mark Robinson in this office. (to Sophie) Get me Mark on the

phone!",29
Rachel," Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is

not the number for (Ross starts making a lot of noise with a handheld pepper grinder) this

store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...(stops and looks at Ross)",43
Rachel," I’m sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I’m

sorry but that’s... (notices a fire that Ross’s candle has started) Oh my God!! ",27
Ross," (putting out the fire with a squeeze bottle of water) Okay, that’s a

fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.",18
Rachel," (on phone) Excuse me, I’m sorry, I’m gonna have to call you

back, I’ve got a Shemp in my office. (hangs up) (to Ross) What are you doing?",28
Ross," I’m sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody’s off the phone, how

‘bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.",25
Rachel," Ross you’re not listening to me, I don’t have time to stop.",12
Ross," Don’t yell at me okay, this is the most I’ve seen you all week.",14
Rachel," Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I’ve got a deadline, would

you just go home, I’ll talk to you later. (storms out) ",24
Ross," No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.",11
Rachel," (throws her stuff down) I was gonna give you a chance to apologize to

me.",15
Ross, For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?,11
Rachel," You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring

a picnic basket to somebody’s work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!",27
Ross," Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our

anniversary, boy what an ass am I. ",20
Ross," Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don’t feel like I even

have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.",20
Rachel," Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my

job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?",27
Ross," No, but it’d be nice if you realized, it’s just a job!",12
Rachel," Ross do you realize this is the first time in my life I’m doing

something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing

something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...",42
Ross," No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya,

but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I

don’t know what to do anymore.",35
Rachel," Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again,

Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard.",23
Ross," Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to

do.",15
Rachel," I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take

a break.",14
Ross," Okay, okay, fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a

break, (goes to the door) let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yogart, or

something.. (opens the door)",29
Rachel, No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.,11
Chandler," So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big

anniversary dinner.",14
Ross," Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we’re gonna break-up instead.",10
Monica," Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi

ce soir? (Mischa laughs) Why? What did I say?",22
Monica, Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.,13
Phoebe," (laughing and banging her spoon on the table) Knock, knock, knock,

knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros

Boutros Ghali said in the New York Times.",35
Phoebe," Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please

tell Sergei that I really like his suit.",21
Phoebe," Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. (Behind the menu) What

are you doing?",17
Phoebe," Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven’t

been able to say two words to each other.",22
Monica," What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a

conversation?",17
Rachel," No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!",10
Ross," What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.",11
Chandler," Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.",15
Ross," Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don’t I have to

wait a while?",18
Chandler," Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!",12
Rachel," Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful.

I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted

to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.",46
Rachel," No. (grabs an egg roll) And then I called him, and he wasn’t there.",14
Rachel," Oh, thank you that’s very helpful, I’m glad you came over.",11
Ross," Really? I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t,

don’t you think we can work on this? ",18
Ross," Yeah! Got it! (slams the phone down, and walks back to the bar.)",13
Ross," Look, I don’t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?",13
Phoebe," Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don’t accidentally suck

it up through your nose and choke on it.",21
Phoebe," Excuse me, but umm, isn’t he paying for your dinner?",10
Monica," It will be my pleasure. (to Phoebe) My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your

guy can’t even say coupons. (they leave)",20
Rachel," (picks up the phone and calls Ross) Oh, be home, be home, be home, be

home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you’re not home.",32
Phoebe," Ameri-can. Y'know it’s a very hard language. Let’s do

it again.",11
Ross," I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.",12
Rachel," You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve

got a girlfriend?",18
Rachel," Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look,

urrgh, maybe we should take a break.",21
Ross," Fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break, (goes to

the door) let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yoghurt, or something..

(opens the door)",27
Rachel," Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a

break, I don’t want to take a break.",23
Ross," (on the phone) I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t,

don’t you think we can work on this? ",20
Monica," What?! (She accidentally starts the blender without the lid on it and

fruit flies everywhere.)",15
Rachel," (looking up at the ceiling) God, Monica it’s on the ceiling.",11
Monica," That’s okay, this is more important than fruit (pause) (angrily) on

my ceiling! You broke up?!",16
Rachel," Yeah, but it’s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.",11
Rachel," No, no-no, it’s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realized

how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to

make it work.",34
Rachel," (on answering machine) Hi, it’s me. I’ve been trying to reach

you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and

Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid. ",36
Rachel," Eh, I’m just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I

don’t want to get back together over a machine.",23
Ross," Umm, oh, hey, I don’t know. How about a big one?",11
Ross," Well then a small one!! Listen, let’s, we kinda have to get going!",13
Ross," You, you sure you need shoes? (Chloe nods her head) Okay. (reaches down

and picks up a shoe)",18
Ross," Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?

(He’s frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe)

Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!! ",44
Ross," Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I’m feeling. Well.... (picks up

her coat)",16
Ross," Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between

their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind

the door) Rachel!!!!",34
Rachel, So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?,11
Phoebe," Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.",13
Phoebe," The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.",10
Monica," Okay, all right don’t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw 

this infomercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before,

except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so

amazing....",47
Phoebe," Oh, it’s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.",11
Phoebe," God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do

that?",13
Monica," Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain

forest!",12
Joey," Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to

make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you should have done. Huh?",25
Ross," You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do?

Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I

can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell

her what I did.",52
Chandler," Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more

important question. How dumb are you?",18
Ross," What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How

am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?",25
Joey," Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am,

just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble.",23
Chandler," He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just

gonna hurt her.",11
Joey," Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild.",10
Chandler," All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait

until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.",23
Ross," Yeah, okay. (he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the

footrest extended.)",15
Joey," All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out

some other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about

the trail?",33
Joey," (stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The

trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!

(slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!",46
Chandler," Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s

sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s

friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it!",34
Phoebe," (reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linen

strips to leg number one, ",15
Phoebe," Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull

it off in one quick pain free motion.",21
Monica," No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with

a little wax.",18
Phoebe," Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t

seem to think it’s that bad.",18
Monica," That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so

stupid. But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest.",23
Monica," Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?",11
Ross," Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?",13
Ross," Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?",10
Ross," You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we

haven’t actually met...",17
Ross," Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.",16
Ross," Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her.",11
Ross, Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister.,13
Ross," We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller.",10
Ross," I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe

yet?",14
Ross," Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much,

and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?",25
Ross," Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to

Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.",21
Monica," Okay, I got an idea. Why don't you pull 

off mine, and I pull off yours?",16
Phoebe," Or, you pull off yours, and I will leave 

mine on.....because I think I can make this look work.",19
Phoebe," For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever

experience.",15
Chandler," Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless

you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.",25
Joey," Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men,

that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax.",25
Phoebe," Oh yeah, come here. (Puts a little wax on Joey’s arm and puts a

strip on it.)",17
Joey," Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?",10
Ross," (forcing the door open) Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!",13
Rachel, I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!,13
Monica, (going over to listen at the door) Rachel said everything was okay.,12
Ross," No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?",10
Rachel, A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!,12
Phoebe," Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not

grow at all yesterday.",17
Chandler," Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....",12
Monica," Oh!! (hits Chandler and Joey in the head) You guys knew about this and

you didn’t tell us?!",18
Chandler," (to Joey) He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.",12
Rachel," (opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! ",13
Ross, No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.,10
Rachel," Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk

about it!! How was she?",18
Ross," I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself,

and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy,

and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.",48
Rachel," Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend

leave? (Ross can’t answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She

was in there, when I was in there?!",36
Ross," Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant

nothing to me!",16
Ross," Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardize. I

thought we were broken up. ",16
Ross," That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.",15
Rachel, You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality?,11
Ross," Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our

relationship was dead!",16
Rachel," Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!",12
Joey," Y'know what, I don’t think we should listen to this anymore. (Goes to

open the door)",16
Monica," (stopping him) What, what are you doing? You can’t go out there.",12
Rachel, God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!,10
Ross," Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to

make sure that didn’t happen!",22
Rachel," Oh, that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over

again.",16
Chandler," Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more

important things to worry about.",19
Ross," Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then

Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.",22
Chandler," (handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, we’re never leaving,

ever.",12
Ross," Don’t you realize none of this would’ve ever happened if I

didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark?",23
Rachel," All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been

able to forgive me?",17
Rachel," You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked

with me, and made love to me?",21
Ross," (covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay,

okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because

it’s, I mean it’s you.",29
Joey," Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic

message to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza.",23
Ross," Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself.",14
Rachel," Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes, I’d like to order a large pizza.",12
Rachel," Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in

the sauce?",17
Chandler," Yeah, come on, it’s Ross and Rachel, they’ve got to.",10
Joey," Well y'know, I’ve been walking the same way since high school.

Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I

need a ‘take notice’ walk.",33
Ross," What, now you’re not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee

table) Look Rachel, I-I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind. I

thought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane

must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don’t cheat right, I,

that’s not me, I’m not Joey!",65
Joey," Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a ‘come on’

look.) Yeah, okay.",14
Monica," Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve

come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.",26
Ross," Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that,

that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that

ran when things got just a little rough!",34
Ross," Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What

do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do

you wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible,

stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I

can’t. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just can’t see us

throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.",100
Rachel," No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Don’t! You can’t

just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work

that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?",37
Ross," (moving over to stand in front of her) Okay, okay. This morning you said

there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together...",26
Ross," Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay,

(takes a hold of one of her arms.) I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine my life

without you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without, without these arms, and your

face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her

waist) and, and....",65
Rachel," (crying) No. I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me

now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now

I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t, (Ross stands up and backs away)

it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed,

everything. Forever.",61
Monica, Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?,10
Phoebe," Oh come on, they can be in the same room.",10
Joey," Well Ross was hangin’ out over at our place, Rachel comes over to

borrow some moisturizer from Chandler....",18
Chandler," Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to

borrow something.",15
Joey, Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.,10
Phoebe," Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with

someone else. ",15
Joey," Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened,

that she should of forgiven him by now.",23
Phoebe," Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what

he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first

you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know

you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.",56
Chandler," Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced.

Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.",25
Phoebe," Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they

never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....",28
Chandler," Y'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay, I mean it’s been a

week.",13
Joey," Yeah, I mean it’s never taken me a week to get over a relationship.",14
Monica," It’s never taken you more than a shower to get over a

relationship.",13
Monica," Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close.",12
Phoebe," (turning around and picking a cup off of a table) Oh, hey, look, I found

coffee! (handing her the cup) Okay, let’s skedaddle.",23
Phoebe," (in a deep voice, imitating Ross) Um, Rachel I’m really sorry.

(imitating Rachel) That’s okay, do you wanna get back together? (imitating Ross)

Yeah, okay. (in her normal voice) Did anyone else hear that?!",34
Rachel," You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five

tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. (they’re

all silent and look away) Okay, I said that out loud right?",38
Chandler," Yes, yes, it’s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans

with Ross.",15
Phoebe," No, it’s just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he

wants y'know, us to check it out.",21
Chandler," Yeah, he’s really excited about it too, he even recorded show

times on his answering machine.",16
Joey," Rach, it’s, it’s ah, it’s not that we don’t want to,

really. (quietly) Are we talking models in their underwear?",20
Joey," (He turns around to Chandler looking for approval to go with Rachel,

Chandler mouths ‘Come on!’) (turning back to Rachel) Ross, did ask us first, and

we set that night aside.",31
Rachel," No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that’s only fair. (leaves)",13
Chandler, (jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!,10
Chandler," Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I’m,

I’m smoking still.",12
Phoebe, Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?,11
Chandler," Look, I’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which

is when I started smoking in the first place.",21
Chandler," Yeahhh. I’m tellin’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after

nap time....",12
Chandler," Oh that’s great, with my luck, that’s gonna be him.",10
Chandler," Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got

divorced is when I started using humor as a defense mechanism. (answers the door and

it’s Rachel again.)",31
Rachel," Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my

sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing.

Huh? I’m asking you first, right?!. I mean I’m playing by the ""rules"".",45
Joey," (obviously cold) Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can

cut glass over here!",16
Ross," Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending

this time with me. It’s been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say

thanks.",31
Chandler, Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.,12
Ross," Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon

okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? (in an

Irish accent) Two days of darts, it’ll be great!",41
Joey," It’ll be great for next weekend. I mean, (in an Irish accent)

it’ll be grrreat.",15
Phoebe," Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel’s

sister’s cabin. (Chandler goes back to the window to smoke again.)",22
Monica," We’re really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.",10
Ross," Yeah, that’s okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for

the first weekend I’m alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.",27
Phoebe," Y'know what, I can stay, I’m gonna stay. ‘Cause the last time

I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.",31
Joey," Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your

grandmother’s cab, but y'know what, I’ll stay.",21
Ross," Pity food? Y'know what that’s okay, all right, I don’t need any

of you to stay, okay nobody stays.",19
Joey," (to Chandler and Monica) Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?",12
Chandler," (to Joey) Well he’s probably mad after you called him this

morning to borrow his goggles.",16
Phoebe," No, the ‘No Smoking’ sign. There’s no smoking in my

Grandmother’s cab.",12
Chandler," Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.",10
Monica, No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.,14
Chandler," Oh, come on, there’s a rest stop right up there! Come on, I

really have to goooooooooo.",17
Phoebe," (to Rachel, who’s staying in the cab.) Aren’t you gonna go?",11
Rachel," Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is ‘no

tissue, no tushy.’ (Phoebe laughs and gets out.) Well, if everybody’s going.

(She gets out and starts to close the door.)",35
Phoebe," No, y'know what don’t close it (Rachel slams the door shut locking

themselves out.) ‘cause the... keys...are in there.",19
Chandler, (to Joey) My lighter’s in there! (points to the cab),10
Chandler, Damn! (stands up) The tailpipe’s not hot enough to light this!,11
Joey," Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?",12
Chandler," Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put

it on this morning.",22
Monica," So, if you’re parents hadn’t got divorced, you’d be able

to answer a question like a normal person?",18
Joey," Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys

give me the under wire from your bra!",24
Joey," Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the

biggest wire.",14
Joey," If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.",14
Rachel," What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually

sometimes, st-stuff my bra.",16
Chandler," Ladies, ladies, let’s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take

off Monica’s bra.",12
Phoebe," All right, forget it, never mind, you can have mine.",10
Rachel," (seeing him) Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right

there.",14
Chandler," Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and

save us.",15
Monica," (looks at Phoebe's bra) Wow. This is 

nice. Were you planning on meeting somebody up there? (Phoebe grabs her bra 

back.) ",21
Chandler, At least let me smoke it to the good part.,10
Phoebe," Okay. (The car moves a few feet and sputters to a stop.) Oh, no!",14
Ross," Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you

get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages

coming home?",33
Ross," Ahh. (notices the table) Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?",14
Ross," Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?",10
Ross," Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. ‘Cause you

know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so

Rachel and I broke up.",30
Ross," I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. (he sits down at the

table.)",17
Phoebe," Okay, yeah. (to Monica and Rachel) Triple A can pick us up.",12
Phoebe," (to Monica) Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route

we’re on?",16
Phoebe," Okay. (on phone) We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. (to Rachel)

There is no Route 27. (listens) (to Rachel) Okay, either 93 or 76?",28
Rachel," I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we

drove up here.",16
Phoebe," Okay. (on phone) Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check

every rest stop, and, and also 93? (listens) Okay! (hangs up) Yeah, no they don’t do

that.",31
Monica," Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a

half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.",35
Rachel," No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live

here! ",18
Rachel," No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to

think of something else.",19
Joey," Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.",13
Chandler," I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another

cigarette.)",15
Ross," ....right? Right? I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they

just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don’t, I don’t need

them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.",38
Ross," (looking at the page) 717? (to Carol) Where’s 717? (He gets up to

return the page, Carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen, but Ross

grabs the last piece.) Hey, you’ve have more of these for Susan right?",43
Monica," (running over to stop Rachel) Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a

penny. Let’s stock up. (takes her into the bathroom)",22
Phoebe," Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don’t know where we are, so

we can’t get a tow truck.",21
Ross," Well, oh, I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I’m a little

too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got

home safely okay?",35
Ross," We were on a break!!! Okay!! (grabs the phone) We were, we were..., (calms

down) yeah. Where are you? I’ll find you. (hangs up)",24
Joey," That’s ‘help’ spelled backwards so that the helicopters can

read it from the air!",14
Rachel," (all excited) Op, op, car! Car!! (sees it’s Ross) Ugh!!!",10
Ross," He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I’m stepping on

some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I’ve got plenty of people to help

on the Interstate.",33
Phoebe," (to Chandler and Monica) You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who

drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we’re then

gonna go skiing?",35
Joey," Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?",11
Monica," I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?",14
Monica," Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?",11
Ross," (sarcastic) Oh please, can’t I come to your special, magical cabin?",11
Rachel, Why would you even want to come Ross? You’re a horrible skier.,12
Chandler," Y'know what, I can handle it, handle’s my middle name. Actually

it’s the ah, middle part of my first name.",20
Rachel," Oh, I’m sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone

else?",13
Rachel," Y'know Ross why don’t you put that on your answering

machine!",11
Ross," Hey-hey, it’s valid okay? And I’m not the only one who thinks

so, Monica agrees with me.",17
Monica," What I said was, was that I understood. Joey’s the one who agreed

with you!",15
Phoebe," Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.",12
Ross," (to Rachel) Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do.

No-no-no-no.",15
Chandler," Guys, guys, guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to

stop the fighting.)",16
Phoebe," Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! (they all stop fighting, Chandler continues

to dance.) Look what you’re doing to Chandler!! (Chandler finally stops) (to Ross and

Rachel) Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? (Ross starts

to leave) You don’t, all right you don’t have to love each other, okay? You

don’t, you don’t even have to like each other much right now. But please, you

have to figure out a way to be around each other.",82
Phoebe," Yeah, otherwise, I mean that’s, that’s, that’s just it

for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? (they both look away) Can you

be civil?",28
Phoebe," Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause

it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.",18
Joey," Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who’s going

with who?",16
Ross," Look, you guys, you guys should go. (Joey tries to say something, but Ross

cuts him off.) No, I’m, you, you planned this all out, and I don’t want to ruin

it, so you guys should just go.",38
Joey," Come on man, you drove all the way up here.",10
Ross," No, no, really, I’ve got to take the car back anyway, I’m

spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It’s fine, no guilt I promise.",24
Phoebe, Maybe we can like go to a movie or something. ,10
Ross," Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the

best one I could, ‘cause that’s not where you want to skimp.",29
Ross," Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even

110?",17
Ross," So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go,

y'know?",15
Joey," Oh, nothing, no. It’s an acting exercise, I’m 

practicing my fake

laugh.",12
Chandler, Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.,12
Rachel," Well, I’m really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that

is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)",23
Chandler," Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking

patch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake

laughs.)",33
Rachel," Come on, it’s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two

weeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since.",21
Rachel," Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of

three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks. ",21
Ross," Look, I was 

trying to distract attention from that poor, old woman who was trying to stuff 

her breasts into the tube socks. ",23
Phoebe," All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have

to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.",32
Ross," Sorry. (To remedy that, Ross scoops the cinnamon off of the top with his

hand.)",15
Chandler," Y'know, I would’ve bet good money that he’d be the first one

of us to get married.",17
Monica," Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don’t you think he’s a little young to

get married?",14
Ross," Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.",13
Phoebe," Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you’re ready for that?",10
Phoebe, Oh good! Okay. ‘Cause you were acting like you didn’t.,10
Monica," And y'know what, I just realized, in the last year I’ve only gone

out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you

gotta get me back in the game.",39
Rachel," Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all

I meet are eligible straight men.",20
Monica," (to a customer) Pete, can I get you something else?",10
Monica," Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig,

and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.",27
Rachel," (laughs) Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean

that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what I mean. That wig all in

disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know. ",41
Phoebe," No, I know, I know, that this is Frank’s life, (walks behind them,

they turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. Y'know, I don’t want to

be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it’s sick and wrong!",41
Phoebe," No-no, oh, I’m fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts

sticking it’s tongue down my little brother’s throat! ",20
Phoebe," But, I mean, do you think he’s gonna enjoy it when he’s up to

his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not

fair to Frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) and

it-it’s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it’s not good home economics.",62
Ross," Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s gonna be married, and

then you’re gonna hate yourself.",17
Phoebe," Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean

look at him and his Mom, I can’t. (pause) But, you guys can, please you gotta talk

him out of it.",35
Phoebe," Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose.

Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!",22
Joey," So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say,

“Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,” remember? And then, and

then, you turn to me and say, “Nah, let’s just hang out at your place.”

Well, that was a nice move dumb ass. ",50
Rachel, I think you should definitely go out with this guy.,10
Monica," Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids….

(realizes) All right, I get your point.",19
Chandler," Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just

carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?",22
Chandler," Good! I haven’t smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and

confident, that is a stunning blouse.",16
Rachel," Hey Mon, let’s give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems

really nice, and that check thing was adorable.",22
Monica," As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000

tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I’d call him.",31
Chandler," (reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete… (quickly grabs a magazine

and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?",26
Monica, Oh my God! That’s Pete! But why is Bill huggin’ Pete?,11
Chandler," This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that

program!",13
Rachel," Oh my God, Monica’s gonna go out with a millionaire. ",10
Rachel," Oh my God, I can’t believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is

just so exciting.",18
Joey," Yeah, come on, think about it. You’re 18, okay, she’s 44, when

you’re 36, she’s gonna be 88.",18
Chandler," (walks out of his bedroom) All right, 

I'm gonna go play basketball.  Or at least let the really good guys use my 

ball while I say ""Can I play? Can I play?"" (opens the door and sees Joey's keys 

still in the key hole) Oh uh, Joe, you left your keys in the door.",54
Chandler," Here you go.  (Throws him his 

keys in a very feminine way and leaves. Both Ross and Joey look at each other in 

shock and Joey picks up the keys from the floor. Both Ross and Joey turn back 

around to talk to Frank.)",44
Joey," Look, the point is, there’s a lot of women out there you haven’t

even had sex with yet!",18
Ross," Yeah, he-he’s right, he’s right. This is your time y'know, yeah,

you’re young, you’re-you’re weird, chicks dig that.",18
Ross," No the man’s right, that’s what I had with Rachel.",10
Ross," Don’t ask me, I had it and I blew it!",10
Joey," I don’t know, maybe I can’t. I mean, maybe there’s

something wrong with me.",14
Phoebe," Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I’m so glad you could come, ‘cause

I’ve got a real umm, Home Ec emergency. (Points to the table cloth, which has a huge

mustard stain on it.)",33
Phoebe," Yeah, I know. It’s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?",11
Phoebe," Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.",11
Monica," You’re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I

mean, what’s-what’s the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way

you get girls to go out with you?",37
Monica, ‘Cause I don’t want to encourage this kind of behavior.,10
Phoebe," Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?",12
Phoebe," Yeah, yeah, no, I don’t, I don’t know. But, y'know what, maybe

it’s just all for the best?",18
Phoebe," Uh, well I can tell you why. It’s, it’s because of me. But,

y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?",24
Phoebe," Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made

her see why you two shouldn’t be together, y'know. And you’re gonna see it to,

one day, you really, really will.",37
Joey," Yeah, uh, all right Ross, if you had a 

million dollars  what's the first thing you'd buy?",17
Ross," I'd probably get some municipal bonds, and then put the rest in 

the bank, and live off the interest.",19
Chandler, (in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around),12
Monica," Guys, please, I’m just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?",10
Chandler," Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him

anything.",15
Joey," Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?",12
Monica," And that’s why, I’m not inviting you in for a drink. (starts

to leave) Bye.",15
Monica," (in the hallway) So, where do you want to go?",10
Monica," Oh come on, it’s only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is

that enough lire?",17
Phoebe," Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally

evil thing, but I so didn’t. There’s someone here who can explain this better

than I can.",31
Phoebe," That’s right, exactly. (sees them) All right, it’s a good bye

kiss, that’s good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (They

both lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay, no, the important thing is that

you see what I’m saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (They ignore

her) Okay, I’ve decided I’m gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my

purse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay, all right, good. (leaves).",85
Joey," (He’s recorded his voice on the tape) Joey’s your best friend.

You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. (he laughs) And you also want to buy him

hundreds of dollars worth of pants. ",35
Rachel," Hi! All right, let’s go shoppin’!!

I got a positive balance on my credit card and I want to 

use it up before Citibank goes under. ",26
Monica," Oh wow. Would it be able to recognize my 

voice (in a granny-type of voice) if I talked like this?",20
Monica," All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quickly

kisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye.",23
Chandler," Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold

separately.",10
Monica," He’s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He’s so

funny, and sooo sweet, and I’m not attracted to him at all!!",25
Monica," Noo!! It’s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he’s like

the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.",23
Chandler, Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?,10
Joey," (entering, dancing and singing) Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old

baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! (He dances around the dinner table

and exits)",32
Ross, I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.,10
Chandler," Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm

is going to get you.",16
Joey," Good. (He sets his stuff down and starts talking to Kate, another cast

member.) Hey.",15
Joey," Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I’m Joey Tribianni.",11
Joey," Dr. Drake Ramorey. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable

neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.",14
Joey," See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I

couldn’t. Now, see, that’s acting.",18
Rachel," Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m gonna tell him no.",15
Rachel," I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this

Gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I’m

standing there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him,

which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I’d be cheating on Ross

or something.",61
Phoebe," Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet and

you have issues with your father.",19
Joey," I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company 

about that infomercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and

whenever I can’t do it, they’re all like-like laughing at me.",40
Ross, So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.,12
Ross," Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realizes that life without

me.... a-sucks.",15
Chandler," It’s possible. You are very loveable, I’d miss you if I

broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.",26
Chandler," (in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, I’d miss you.",13
Rachel," Yeah. Ahh, here’s a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)",12
Rachel," Oh, y'know, it’s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD’s, just

sort of stuff that you’ve left here.",19
Ross, What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?,12
Rachel," No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it’s time we-we y'know,

move on. I mean, I mean don’t’ you think?",21
Ross," Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-this

was a gift?!",17
Rachel," Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.",11
Ross, It’s still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!,11
Rachel," Okay, all right, give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug.",11
Ross," No!! Y'know-y'know don’t do me any favors. In fact, where,

where’s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, this

book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I’d like that back too.

Yes, I do.",44
Rachel," You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that

T-shirt!",14
Rachel," Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....",11
Ross," Small... (Rachel comes back into the living room and catches Ross mocking

her.)",13
Ross," I’m-I’m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (he

kisses the shirt)",15
Rachel," You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn’t even

fit you anymore!",16
Ross," Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on

the T-shirt. It’s an old ‘Frankie says relax’ T-shirt, that barely fits

him. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you don’t mind I’m

gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favorite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have a

pleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)",69
Phoebe," Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name

it after yourself.",17
Monica," Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head

and says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, I’m running

out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I

only attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, or

they’re too young, or they're a big misogynist jerk 

like Julio. Who, by the way, I'm still attracted to. And then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me,

and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on! I mean,

seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?!",112
Joey," Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh?

Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin’. You look

at me, and it’s nothin’. (He kisses her) Nothing.",38
Joey," Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it’s says so in the script! Y'know

ah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script

here that you’re a bitch.",36
Chandler," I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter, I

still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing

on the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?",47
Chandler," Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the

peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!",21
Ross," I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she’d say

no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!",29
Chandler," You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I

mean bullets have left guns slower!",19
Ross," Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight,

I’m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can’t, I can’t watch this. (turns away,

then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go,

she’s going in.",45
Ross," She’s going in. Wait! He’s going in! He’s going in!! The

door’s closed! I, I can’t see anything but the door closed!!",22
Chandler, And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.,11
Ross," Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!",15
Ross," I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there 

will do it. Look, this guy is bad news, Chandler. I can 

sense he's an operator. ",30
Chandler," Rachel wouldn't date an operator.  

They only make 20 grand a year and they have to work nights.  (Ross looks 

like he is about to punch Chandler.)",27
Ross, I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!,12
Chandler," I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!

(Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly

strong!",29
Chandler," Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the

door shut with his feet.) ",17
Chandler," She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna

be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you

are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man?

It’s over.",43
Chandler," I know. (He rubs Ross’s head and 

steps down) I know.   Is it me, or did 

""subletting my peephole"" sound kind of dirty? (Ross thinks about it.)",27
Rachel," Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is

missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’",22
Rachel," Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know?

I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to

you.",28
Monica," (looks around) Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I’m gonna

say, midget rodeo.",14
Monica," Okay. Umm, y'know, I don’t think, I don’t think I told you

this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.",24
Monica," So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn’t the thing. Umm,

the thing is that, right now I’m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on

me. Y'know what I mean?",38
Monica," Well, um, look I-I don’t want this to come our wrong, but ah, you

seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn’t attracted too.",27
Chandler," I don’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.

(He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a

gunfighter in a Western.) ",37
Chandler," (to Joey) I wasn’t doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing

his stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?",19
Joey," Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she’s like the

greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!",18
Joey," God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, ‘Oh, I’m so

talented.’ and ‘Oh, I’m so pretty,’ and ‘Ooh, I smell so

good.’",26
Joey," Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?",12
Chandler," Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you

were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!",30
Joey," Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual

scenarios and stuff huh?!",18
Joey," Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh?

Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and it’s nothin’.

You look at me, and nothin’. (He kisses her, more passionately this time) Nothing.",42
Phoebe," (to Chandler) Hey! (Chandler looks up, startled) Why isn’t it

Spiderman? Y’know like Goldman, Silverman...",15
Chandler," No, it’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider, man.

Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there’s no Gold Man.",25
Rachel," Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair.",12
Monica," By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.",11
Rachel," Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw it

out, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)",29
Rachel," (She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take

a deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)",28
Chandler," So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?",10
Phoebe," Ahh, his work is done.  Okay, I 

have a friend, Jimmy Tupperman, what would his powers be?",17
Chandler," Tupper Man!  He would keep 

criminals fresh until the police came. Okay, let’s play my game now.",17
Phoebe," Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! (they both kick

up the foot rests like an old fashioned gun fight.)",18
Chandler," Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the

only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!",22
Joey, Yeah! Oh my God! (to Chandler) Is this what it’s like to be you?,14
Joey," Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kiss

her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it’s like

somebody’s ripping out my heart!",34
Phoebe," Oh, it’s so great to see you feeling like this!",10
Ross," Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.",12
Phoebe," Wait, am I missing something though? ‘Cause I thought death was

something that’s supposed to be sad, in a way.",20
Ross," Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.",10
Monica," Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (Ross gives her a look) (to

Ross) And I’m sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?",27
Phoebe," Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.",17
Monica," Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to

play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.",32
Chandler," My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me. 

(They all look at him.)  More of a bathtub-type of 

situation.",22
Ross," Now Monica, she did give you one chance.  

She told Monica she could play with the dollhouse if she lost 20 pounds.",22
Monica," (looks up) Yeah, well, look who's losing 

weight now, Aunt Sylvia. ",11
Rachel," Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn’t have to walk me all

the way back up here.",17
Chandler," Oh, that’s-that’s okay, no problem. (He starts to look

around her office.)",12
Rachel," Honey um, honey, you do realize that we don’t keep the women’s

lingerie here in the office?",17
Rachel," (introduces them) Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing (to Chandler)

Joanna.",12
Chandler," Thanks, it’s ah, Gaelic, for ‘Thy turkey’s done.’

So ah, I’m gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.",17
Rachel," Oh, nothing, he’s just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice

it anymore.",13
Rachel," Well, I’ll ask him for you, if you want me too?",11
Monica," Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper’s a little faded, that’s okay.

Carpet’s a little loose. Hardwood floors!!",16
Phoebe," I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. (She

removes this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to the

house.)",34
Phoebe," Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive

waste.",13
Chandler, (holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?,11
Phoebe," Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one, because the house

is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.",20
Ross," Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient

Indian burial ground? That would never happen.",20
Phoebe," Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government.",10
Chandler," Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.",11
Rachel," Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about

you...",13
Chandler," Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin’

out the Chan-Chan man!",16
Rachel," (looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you

interested at all?",16
Rachel," Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she’s gonna love me.",12
Phoebe," (holding a dinosaur) Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the

house!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.)

Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!",27
Monica," Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, all

right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size,

they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go.",31
Phoebe," Okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur, we’re not

welcome in the house of no imagination.",19
Ross," Uh, Pheebs, while we’re hovering around the subject. I just have to

say dinosaurs, they-they don’t go, rrroof!",18
Joey," Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last

week...",14
Joey," (to himself) And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was

good, yeah...",19
Joey," Well Ahh, (he sees Kate and the director kissing) yeah! Yeah, sure, a

drink sounds great.",16
Ross," (to Monica) Y'know if you wanna make the 

boys' bathroom realistic you're gonna have to put some teeny, tiny porno 

magazines behind the toilet. ",24
Phoebe," Look, look! (She lifts up the roof, and the front panel falls revealing

the interior.)",15
Phoebe," Oh, okay, it’s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slides

a doll down the slide)",17
Phoebe," The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come

over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.",22
Phoebe," Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights some

incense)",14
Monica," Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!",10
Phoebe," Watch, watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around the

house.)",13
Rachel," (to Chandler) O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.",10
Chandler," Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there’s nothing

like a cool, crisp New York evening. ",18
Chandler," Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, because

Joanna’s such a big, dull dud!",17
Joey," Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?",10
Joey, (to Kate) That guy’s like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?,14
Joey," Hey, I’m not interested in her sweater! It’s what’s

underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who

I’m going out with?",28
Joey," Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?",10
Joey," Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah,

y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.",28
Joey," Yeah, yeah, and then Adrianne, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his

waist.",15
Joey," And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and,

and, and bite her!",19
Joey," Oh, it was so amazing. After the (pause) love making...",10
Joey," Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in

and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep

going like this. (He closes his eyes and moves them around, kinda like he’s been

processed by the devil, or something.)",50
Chandler," (entering with Rachel) I’m telling ya, Joanna’s got it all

wrong. Okay? All I said was, ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime.

I’ll give you a call.’",29
Rachel," Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her?",12
Chandler, That’s what you say at the end of a date.,10
Rachel," You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night?’",10
Joey," (with a big smile on his face) I'm so 

happy!",10
Chandler," Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standing

there, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’

and it’s just y'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion.",37
Monica," Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’t

mean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you?",24
Rachel," Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you

are my boss.",16
Rachel, (grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!,12
Rachel," Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand.

Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out,

she’s gone crazy!",28
Rachel," Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you

haven’t called her. You have to call her!",20
Chandler," Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say,

‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’",20
Rachel, Well then you’re going to have to take her out again.,11
Chandler," Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop

thing in the corner of her eye!",18
Rachel," I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her

out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I

don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!",50
Chandler," All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an

hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody

ever again!",34
Joey," So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you

ah, did you talk to Marshall?",22
Joey," What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you

can’t tell me last night didn’t mean something to you. I-I was there,

you’re not that good an actress.",34
Monica," Oh, that’s okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower

massager.",13
Monica," (runs over to her) I tried to reach you at work. There’s....been a

fire.",14
Phoebe," What?! Oh my... (sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! What

happened?!",14
Ross," Well, we believe it originated here. (He uses a pointer and points to the

point of origin.) In the Aroma Room.",21
Phoebe," Ohh. What is this? (She sees a tissue covering something, and moves to

remove it.)",15
Ross," No Phoebe, don’t look! You don’t want to see what’s under

there!!",12
Phoebe," (She pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) Ohh, the-the

Foster puppets! ",13
Chandler," It’s not a big deal. It’s, just it’s right here,

(points to his eye) and it’s all the time.",19
Chandler," (He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was

pleasant.",14
Chandler," Well, this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it again

sometime. (Rachel is disappointed) ",18
Chandler," Look, I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry.",10
Rachel," Okay, you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now.

(She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)",23
Chandler," I’m sorry. I’m-I’m-I’m sorry that I said I was

going to when I’m not. It's just that I was trying to 

be nice and you don't deserve that.",28
Chandler," Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this

isn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious, serious problems when it

comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. And

I’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out.",51
Chandler," Well this is great! I’ll give you a call! We should do it again

sometime!",15
Joey," (on phone) Well, so anyway Beth, what I’m saying is I should’ve

considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I’ve ah, I’ve

recently learned what’s it like to be on your side of it, and I’m sorry. So, do

you think you can forgive me? (listens) Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. (He sits down and

crosses out something, and dials the phone again.) Hello, Jennifer? (listens) Oh hi, Mrs.

Loreo, is Jennifer there? (listens) Oh, she’s not home huh? (listens) Well ah,

actually I kinda need to talk to you too.",94
Rachel, So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?,13
Monica," Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.",11
Phoebe," Yeah! Okay, here you go. (rolls her back to Rachel)",10
Joey," (leaving Central Perk and seeing Monica laying on top of Rachel who is

moaning in pain.) Oh my.",18
Joey, Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.,10
Chandler," Oh, so that’s why the priest threw holy water on me.

(there’s no reaction from Joey) Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You

should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here

crying all day about Kate.",46
Joey," Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy’s theory.

Okay?",11
Ross," Yeah! They’re putting together this panel to talk about these fossils

they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel’s gonna film it!",23
Chandler, Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.),12
Joey," (on phone) Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? ‘Cause I

was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!",27
Monica," Hi! Hey, Pete you’re back! Hey, check this out. (She starts to

skate over to him)",16
Monica," Wow! You’re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece

of paper. So how was you’re trip?",19
Monica," Oh, what’d ya bring me?! (She opens the gift) Awww, hotel

toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection.",23
Rachel, What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?,10
Monica," I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven

and opened Easy Monica’s Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can

totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. (She removes her fake breasts) But

Pete’s just doing this because he has a crush on me.",61
Monica," Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I

can’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.",27
Rachel," Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health

teacher.",11
Rachel," Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.",14
Ross," (entering, wearing a white suit with a little red bow tie) Hey, you guys!

Guess what?",16
Rachel, (looking at the outfit) Got a job on a river boat?,11
Ross," Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it.

Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so...",23
Rachel," Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.",10
Rachel," Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as

stupid as you like.",15
Monica," Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.

(Ross starts to leave) Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!",23
Rachel," Oh, c'mon, you kidding? Don't you remember when you used to 

wear that  gray sweat suit? And I used to call you the Hindenburg?",24
Chandler," So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take

for the roller skating thing to happen.",22
Chandler," Okay, so I guess that’s about ah, two weeks before the topless

thing kicks in.",15
Chandler, Okay. (He opens it and it’s a baby chick) It’s a chicken.,12
Phoebe," Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They

require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot’s and lot’s

of love.",27
Joey," Oh, well no problem there. (He picks up the chick, hugs it really tight,

and talks to it like it’s a little baby.)",23
Monica," I can’t do it. I’m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you

have these feelings for me....",19
Monica," Oh, that’s great! I mean I’m-I’m sorry, but I’m so

happy for you. And now I can work for you!",20
Monica," Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! (she rolls over and kisses him

on the cheek) All right, y'know what? I’m just gonna roll right into that office

and-and quit!",31
Monica, Okay. (she gets ready to go) Can you give me a little push?,13
Monica," (rolling towards the office) I’m quitting!! Woo-hoo! (She rolls

through a doorway and out of sight. We then hear a big crash, and see Monica roll past the

door the other way.) I’m okay!! I’m all right!!",37
Phoebe," (to Pete) Wow! That’s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.",13
Phoebe," I’m just saying, this woman, I mean she’s fictitious. No?",10
Phoebe," ‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there was

somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘cause you figure oh if you

spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...",39
Phoebe," Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial

gift.",11
Phoebe," No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks.",11
Chandler," Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick here,

and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick-(Joey

enters)-chickeeeen.",26
Chandler," I don’t know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over, trying to

determine the sex of the chick, and blows on it.) I can’t tell, what ever it was went

back in too quickly.",36
Joey," Well, anyway, I got to go change, I’m ah, meeting some of the cast

for drinks.",16
Chandler," I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody

could be here with our chick!",19
Joey," Hey! Who was up from 2 o’clock this morning until 5 o’clock this

morning trying to get her back to sleep?",21
Chandler, You don’t think I get up when you get up?,10
Chandler," Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you come in

and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?

Well I don’t think so mister!",36
Joey, Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!,11
Chandler, And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?,11
Chandler," I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got this

chick, we’ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?",25
Joey," I don’t know, maybe we weren’t ready to have a chick.",11
Ross," (sees the chick) Ohhh, hey!

 I can't believe you still have that.",12
Ross," All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in

like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? (takes out two suits) This

blue suit, or this brown one?",33
Joey," Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the

blue one.",17
Ross, Really? (Joey gives him a ‘Like I would know’ look),10
Rachel," (she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle, but has trouble

opening it. She pops the top off and aspirins fly all over the place as Ross enters.)",30
Rachel, (She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) Oww!,11
Rachel," Look, I’m fine. Watch. (She picks up an aspirin between her toes)

Look at that. (She lifts her leg to grab the aspirin with her hand and almost falls over.)

Whoa-whoa!",31
Ross," (stopping her from falling) Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a

doctor! Okay?",16
Rachel," No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my boss's

house. It’s a very big deal, there’s a lot of people there I have to meet.",31
Ross," And I’m sure you’re gonna make a big impression. Hi! I’m

Rachel Green. It’s nice to meet you. (He lifts his leg and imitates shaking hands

with it, just like how Rachel was trying to pick up the aspirin with her feet.) Come on,

you probably have a broken rib!",50
Rachel," Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it’ll still be broken

then.",13
Rachel," (with a hurt expression on her face) Okay, but before you go, could you

help me first?",17
Chandler," (rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out

of a VCR?!",18
Rachel," (She drops the brush) Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand!

Would you please, help me with this too?",22
Ross," Ohh. (He drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks the tip. He

doesn’t like how it tastes.)",20
Rachel," (taking the brush back) Okay. Let’s use this brush. (Hands him

another one.)",13
Rachel," Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid.

Okay? Just sweep it.",17
Ross, Oke-dokey. (He pokes her in the eye with the brush.),10
Ross," Sweep, sweep....(He starts to paint it on her eye, making it look like she

has a black eye.)",18
Rachel," We don’t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.",14
Ross," No. No, y'know you don’t, you don’t wear enough of this. (Rachel

is shocked) What?",15
Rachel," Since when, since when do you think I don’t wear enough of this?",13
Ross," Well I, close your eyes, I just think you’re gonna like this a little

better, ‘cause, close-close... (He gets some more on the brush)",24
Ross," (blows it) Sorry. ‘Cause umm, I think this will make you a little

more sophisticated.",15
Monica," Okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me something

that you could tell me.",18
Phoebe," Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn’t tell,

and I swore to like all my gods.",21
Monica, Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?,10
Monica," Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his

bed?",16
Rachel," Sure, I’ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.",10
Ross," Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?",15
Rachel," Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?",12
Ross," Rachel, I’ve seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you

naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?",25
Rachel," Yeah, but that was different. Y’know? I mean, we were, we were

going out then, now I think it’s weird.",20
Ross," Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.",11
Ross, All I have to do is close my eyes. See? (closes his eyes) Woo-hoo!!,14
Rachel, Come on! I don’t want you thinking of me like that any more!,13
Ross," Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It’s one of my ah, rights as

the ex-boyfriend. (closes his eyes again) Oop, oh yeah!",24
Ross," Okay, okay, I’m sorry, it will never happen... (closes eyes) Uh-oh!

Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I’m the king. ",26
Ross," Come on, would you grow up? It’s no big deal.",10
Rachel, All right. (She starts to take off her robe) Fine.,10
Rachel," O-kay!! See what you did, I’m gonna be doing it by myself now.

Okay? ",14
Ross, Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?,10
Ross," Okay, I’m gonna get your coat and then I’ll-I’ll put you in

a cab.",14
Rachel," Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you’re not gonna come with me?",10
Ross, (He thinks about it) Of course I am. I just have to make a call.,15
Rachel," Thank you. (She goes to take off her make-up and screams in pain)

Oww!!!! God!",15
Rachel," I’m sorry, I just can’t go to the hospital lookin’ like

this.",12
Monica," Okay, so it doesn’t involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey.

But, what about Pete?",16
Monica," Okay, I feel like I’m talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would

you just tell me!",16
Monica," Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete’s computer company?",11
Chandler," I know. See, yes. That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely

different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.",23
Joey," (sees he’s watching Baywatch) Ohhh. (sees he still has the

chick) Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store

today.",28
Chandler," I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took her

to the shelter, and you know what I found out? ",24
Chandler," If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m

not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!",21
Joey," Okay, good, good, good, ‘cause, good, ‘cause I was kinda having

second thoughts too. ",14
Chandler," Okay. And it’s not just chicks y'know? It’s all kinds of

other animals!",13
Monica," I don’t believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It’s

gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I’d be cold, but I’m always cold.

Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.",38
Monica," Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much. (runs over and hugs him)",14
Monica," No, it’s not bad. It’s not bad at all. It’s-it’s

really nice.",12
Monica," You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one

who hurts you. That’s why I can’t take this job.",26
Monica," And well, we probably shouldn’t see each other anymore. I’m

sorry.",11
Monica," All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. (She

kisses him back on the lips) Oh, wow! (They then hug and kiss, very passionately.)",29
Chandler," Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!",13
Chandler," That’s a bad duck!!! (to Ross) How’d the thing go tonight,

Ross?",12
Ross," Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. (they go into her

apartment) Easy.",17
Chandler," (to the duck) Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that,

that chick is not a toy! (He goes back into the apartment)",26
Ross," I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.",13
Ross," Eh, ‘cause I knew that if I told you, you’d make me go, and I

knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.",28
Ross," No, that’s, no, as long as you’re okay. So I’ll ah,

I’ll see you tomorrow.",15
Chandler, (coming out of his apartment and seeing Ross) What did you do?,12
Chandler," See, I told you they don’t swim. (He goes to take it out)",13
Chandler," Noo! (takes him out) Oh, it’s okay, it’s okay, baby, baby,

baby.",12
Rachel," Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back

like two hours ago.",19
Phoebe," Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance,

he’s at Flimby’s.",19
Phoebe," Oh, yeah, that’s the word I use when I can’t remember the real

thing.",14
Phoebe," No! Rachel, that’s what they want me to do. My warranty expires

tomorrow, if I don’t get through, they’re not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone

for free! We cannot let them win! It’s us versus them!",37
Joey," Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?",12
Monica," I need two. I’m bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend

now!",13
Chandler," Who’s number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers

play.",12
Ross," Yeah, kinda. It’s this woman from work. I hope that won’t be too

weird. Will it, Rach?",17
Rachel," No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone

myself, so…",16
Joey," Okay. (to Phoebe and Chandler) Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?",13
Joey," Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!",11
Joey," (to Chandler) And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes

it.",15
Monica," Joey, what are you doing?! It’s never gonna happen, she’s

seeing somebody.",12
Monica, (to Phoebe) Here you go. You can wear this. (hands her a sweater),13
Phoebe," Okay. (on phone) Ooh, I’m setting the phone down. (does so) But

I’m still here! Just don’t go anywhere I’m still here. (starts to put on

the sweater) Don’t-don’t switch or anything, ‘cause I’m, I’m

right here. (She has pulled the sweater over her head, but her head is stuck in a sleeve.)

Just one sec. One sec! One second!! (She is now frantically trying to get the sweater on,

as Monica returns from the bathroom.) Wait! One second! Just…",80
Monica, And! We also have speaker phone. (She turns on the speaker phone.),12
Monica," Okay, wait, you gotta hang up ‘cause we’re gonna be late.",11
Phoebe, Yes!! Yes!! I’m the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.,13
Chandler," (entering, carrying the chick and duck) Hey! Can you take a duck and a

chick to the theatre? ",18
Chandler," Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.

(to the chick and the duck) All, right, fellas, back to 

Nintendo. ",23
Rachel," How are you? (She goes to kiss him on the cheek, but stops because of

the dates and pats him on the shoulder.)",23
Rachel," Okay, uhh, I think I’m going to run to the ladies room.",12
Ross," Okay. (The girls leave.) (to Tommy) So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is

awkward.",15
Ross, Well y'know ‘cause Rachel and I used to go out.,10
Ross, Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh…,11
Ross," Okay. (sees two people sitting in their seats.) Uh, huh. Excuse me,

I’m sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.",22
Ross," (looking at ticket) Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh…",11
Chandler, Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.,14
Joey," (sees Kate) Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody.

Everybody, this is Kate.",16
Ross," (drags Chandler over to buffet table) I’m telling you, this guy

Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he’s

baaad news!",28
Chandler," Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don’t like the guy

Rachel’s dating? Well, that’s odd.",16
Joey," Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate’s understudy,

Lauren.",13
Monica," Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short

version.",15
Ross," Hi! Yeah! Tommy’s in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in

front of him, I think he’s gonna snap. (He’s watching very intently)",25
Monica, You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.,13
Phoebe," Oh, okay, yeah. (to Monica) I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff

in your room.",18
Joey," Listen, drama critics they’re nothing but, but people who

couldn’t make it as actors. You know what you should do?",20
Joey," Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.",10
Joey," Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We’ll

stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.",28
Joey," I, I don’t get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with

me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.",29
Joey," Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?",15
Joey," (Checks to see if she’s drooling on his shirt.) Okay. Okay, okay,

hey. (Lays her down and covers her with a blanket.) There we go, let’s get your feet

up there. (Looks at her) Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. (Picks up a garbage can) I’m

gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.",57
Monica," (entering from her bedroom) Pheebs, you’ve been up for 24 hours! Go

to sleep, honey. Th-this isn’t healthy.",18
Phoebe," No, no, I’m fine, and y’know why? ‘Cause of all the

riboflavin.",12
Monica," Yeah, last time I was at Pete's we just 

watched a movie...of us...that we'd made earlier.  (with a big smile) I'm 

sorry, I can't help it. I have a boyfriend!",30
Phoebe," I’m so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you’re

play. I swear you’re play is very important to us, thank you for your patience.

You’re play is the next play is the next play I’m gonna see.",40
Joey," Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much

we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we

stayed up all night talking, and now we’re like totally crazy about each other!",46
Monica," When two people finally realize their feelings for each other, and-and

they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!",23
Rachel," Tommy’s supposed to be here soon, we’re going to lunch.",10
Ross," Look. Look, I wasn’t going to say anything to you, but... All right,

I don’t think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.",22
Ross," No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from

him.",17
Rachel," Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.",10
Ross," No, it’s not just ‘cause I’m jealous. (Both Monica and

Chandler give him a ‘Come on’ look) I mean I’m not, I’m not, I’m

not jealous, okay? It’s… Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at

this couple sitting in our seats.",43
Chandler," Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just

started like, (claps his hands) banging his hands together!",25
Ross," Okay, fine, fine. You don’t want to believe me? No, that’s fine.

(starts to leave)",15
Ross," You don’t want to believe me, I’m Mr. Funny to you. Mr.

Funny… (turns around and almost spills his coffee on Tommy) ",22
Monica," Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.",11
Joey," Sorry! Sorry, I’m late; sorry, I’m late! My duck and my chick

and a fight, it-it was ugly.",18
Joey," Oh, ahh, go to the window. I’m wanna run down to the truck and show

you something.",17
Joey," (grabs the window from the outside and sticks his head in) (whispering)

When is she leaving?",16
Joey, (making like he is yelling up to the second floor) I’m coming up!,13
Monica," (speaking calmly to Phoebe) Hey, you 

hanging in there? You doing okay?",12
Monica," (calmly) Okay. If Pete calls again, and 

you don't put him through I will kill you.",16
Chandler," Why don’t you use ours across the hall, ‘cause

she…has…problems.",10
Ross," (coming out of the kitchen with a cup of coffee, almost running into

Tommy) Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.",26
Rachel," Ross, would you just stop it! It’s getting really old.",10
Phoebe," Yeah. But I also believed her (points to the phone) when she said I was

next.",16
Joey," Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I’ll go to

the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.",26
Joey," Yeah, I guess it is. (sees Kate is watching, he turns Lauren so that he

can talk directly to Kate, but still look like he is talking to Lauren) Listen, I ah, I

gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick ‘cause this is killing me. One thing

you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you’ve got things you have to

do now, and so do I. And so… I’m gonna get on this spaceship, (smoke starts

pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the

side of it) and I’m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I

return, 200 years from now, you’ll be long gone. But I won’t have aged at all.

(gets on the ladder) So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because

Adrienne, baby, I’m gonna want to meet her. ",155
Phoebe," Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it’s one of those 801 numbers. Right?",13
Phoebe," No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it’s has to be 800. (picks up the

instruction manual to check the phone number) ‘Cause all those big companies have 800

numbers, every one. (Finds the number) Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.",40
Phoebe," Well, I think I broke it. But that’s all right, here’s the

number you can call.",16
Joey," Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could

call it Chuck.",18
Ross," Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing

myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.",24
Ross," No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.",11
Ross," Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not

visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.

(starts to take off his pants)",34
Ross," Come on you guys, it's no big deal! (He turns around and shows him his

thing.)",16
Ross," Well what is it? Is it a mole? (He moves closer to them, and they jump

back.)",17
Chandler," No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go

see a… ",15
Rachel," (entering, interrupting them) Hey guys! What's... (sees what they're

doing and stops, the guys are stunned)",16
Phoebe," (to her date) Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I

play my music. (points to the stage)",22
Phoebe," Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.",13
Rachel, Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?,11
Chandler," Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to

an even hundred. ",18
Rachel," Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that

Kindergarten teacher.",14
Rachel, What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.,10
Phoebe," I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two

guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin',

field-playin' juggler.",28
Phoebe," Does a dog's lips move when he reads? (Joey makes an `I don't know'

face, and looks to Chandler and Rachel, who're also stumped) Okay, no they don't.",28
Ross," Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally

benign.",12
Ross," He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of 

skin... abnormality.",15
Ross," Well it's in the skin family. And 

the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he 

was reluctant to remove it.",27
Chandler," Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there

with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean

not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.",43
Ross," At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.",12
Joey," Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross.

And then people would be like, ""Awww, he's got a Ross.""",24
Monica," I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from

Atlanta, we need to talk.",19
Monica," Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something

bad.",14
Joey," Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.",11
Phoebe," That is so great! Oh, I... (sees that a parked car near them has caught

on fire) Oh my God!",20
Phoebe," Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic.



",12
Phoebe," Well, it's pro-probably just really low 

on coolant. (hears the sound of approaching sirens) Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out

of here!",27
Phoebe," Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? (she

drags him away)",18
Ross," Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill

third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!",25
Joey," Hey, you know what you don't see a lot of? 

Topless tap dancing. ",13
Monica," (sarcastically) I really enjoy 

these little talks we have. (starting to get up) I gotta go water Pete's plants. (stops) Y'know

what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.",35
Chandler," Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water

his plants. If y'know what I mean.",21
Joey," Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.",11
Phoebe," (entering with Rachel) …and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just,

always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.",28
Rachel," Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?",12
Phoebe," Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work.

It's like I'm working in the field.",20
Phoebe," Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's

so burly, he's sooo very burly. (giggles)",20
Monica," Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! (the lights

turn on automatically, but are very bright) Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights!

Lights go away! (they dim) Oh, see you just need to find the right command.",42
Joey," Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.",12
Monica," No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be

here, so please, do not touch anything.",19
Phoebe," No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a

great day.",15
Monica," Joey, put that down! (the phone rings) Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get

out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone! (steps in front of it, and automatically

answers it)",32
Monica," Oh it’s umm, good! It's umm, it’s good, just here watering the

plants.",13
Monica," Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so

I know, is it good news or bad news.",24
Joey," (looking at the checkbook) Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000

dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. (Monica is stunned) Oh, sorry, what do you think the

good news is?",33
Ross," Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!",12
Rachel," Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could

be, “Look how much money we’ve got!” Y'know, I mean you could put, you

could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place

settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it’ll be dry, but people

will like it.",61
Monica," Would you stop? We’ve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean

we don’t even know if he’s gonna propose.",22
Chandler," Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He’s not like other people, on your

first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that’s like a third or fourth date

kinda thing.",32
Ross," Monica’s right. We’re talking about getting married here. Okay?

She-she can’t just rush into this.",15
Rachel," Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!",10
Joey," Hey you could do worse Monica. He's a 

really good guy.",11
Phoebe," You know what you should do? Don't 

decide now. Ok, just wait until you're in the moment and whatever you're feeling

that will be your answer. ",26
Rachel," Yeah, Pete gets down on his knee and 

pulls out that pumpkin-sized diamond ring......",14
Phoebe, All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.,11
Phoebe," Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it’s just Jason’s so

sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it’s just better than

having just like a really, really, really nice (pause) butt. (Her eyes glaze over thinking

about the butt.) (pause) Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!",52
Rachel," OH MY GOD!!! (She holds her hands up in triumph and the gang all look at

her.) Sorry, I was just imagining what it’d be like to catch the money bouquet. ",31
Phoebe," Umm, wow. This-this isn’t gonna be easy. Umm, I don’t think we

should see each other anymore.",17
Phoebe," (to Ross) I’m telling you, if you want to take care of that thing,

you should go to my herbal guy.",21
Ross," Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don’t want to make it

savory.",16
Monica," Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they

tell their friends about it.",18
Rachel," (entering) Hi! Okay, don’t be mad at me, but I couldn’t

resist.",12
Rachel," Yes, and I know that you’d say no if he asked you, but I’m

sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Karan. (shows her the

picture.)",32
Phoebe," (gasps) Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. (They both

look at her.) Like for clubbing. ",19
Monica," It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in

bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (Rachel slams the magazine

shut in amazement.) I know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, and

it’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean I

can’t. Right? I mean I’m-I’m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the

same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.",94
Monica, I know. (pause) I need more pie. (goes and gets some),11
Phoebe," Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?",13
Phoebe," No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he’s

incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal

drawings that he drew of me.",33
Phoebe," Yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access

to a lot of charcoal.",17
Phoebe," Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and… Okay so

Jason is sensitive, (holds up one finger) but now so’s Vince (holds up one finger on

her other hand) Plus, Vince has the body y'know? (holds up two more fingers on the Vince

side) So… It’s really just about the math.",54
Ross," Listen, I got to tell you I’ve-I’ve never been to a guru before,

so...",14
Monica, And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.,10
Phoebe," (singing) “Crazy underwear, creepin’ up my butt. (Jason

enters) Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under-(sees Jason)-wear…” (In

her head) Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep

playing. You’ll get through this; you’ll be fine. (She tries to continue the

song, but she has lost the ability to pronounce words, and the lyrics come out as

gibberish.) (giving up on the song) Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me

after the show.",84
Phoebe," I don’t know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!",13
Phoebe," Yeah, okay, I’ve-I’ve been dating both of you, and it’s

been really horrible. ‘Cause y'know it’s been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I

like you both, and I, and I didn’t know how to chose, so... I’m sorry, I’m

just, I’m terrible, I’m a terrible person. I’m terrible.",51
Phoebe," Well, this is none of my business. (starts to walk away)",11
Phoebe," Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.",11
Phoebe," Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I’m gonna do that for you.",14
Chandler," (comforting the duck) Everything’s gonna be all right. Okay,

Dick?",10
Joey," Yeah, yeah. He’s got a, he’s got a really bad cough, and our

vet, he can’t do anything about it. Is there something you can do?",26
Joey," Man. Hey, what if you found out that your 

mom wasn't really your mom. And your new mom turned out to be really hot? 

(chuckles) Oh, man, huh? ",28
Monica," Oh, who? It's not like they have a group 

for people like us. 
",13
Phoebe," Oh, uncanny! (gets her guitar) God, it 

looks like rain and I don't have my umbrella. 
",16
Ross," Hey, why did the chicken 

fall out of the tree?",10
Ross," Because you have doody on your head. 

(laughs by himself) Yeah, it was funnier when Ben told it. 




(Monica goes to check her messages.)",24
Chandler," Hey, you swore you would never tell. 

(mocks that he has a tail)",13
Rachel," And you know what? Actually, I do 

think Kirk was smarter than Spock.  (Ross wants to say something again, but 

just slowly leaves.)",23
Monica," (turns to Rachel before she leaves) Are 

you sure you're okay about this?",13
Joey," (to Chandler) You know, with all our stuff 

gone, the unit doesn't seem that big.",15
Joey," Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we



could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there. (Goes back into the



hall)",27
Chandler, Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!,10
Joey," Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And,



some of it is not even popped! ",16
Rachel," Oh! Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at



this game.",12
Monica, I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her.,11
Monica," Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be a



great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.",24
Ross," Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom



would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do.",27
Monica," You don’t have to stick up for her. She can’t hear



you.",12
Chandler," Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the



street yesterday.",14
Chandler," Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a



drink.",14
Rachel," (laughs) You ah, you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that



did you?",11
Rachel," I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her you



said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’",18
Chandler," Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we



were able to take the relationship to the next level.",22
Rachel," Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must



end it now!",16
Chandler," Oh, come on! It’s not like this is an everyday



occurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself.",24
Rachel," Okay. (Joanna goes into the bathroom.) 

Chandler, promise me you will end this now. ",14
Chandler," I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya, because



she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.",25
Joey," Yeah-eh-eah! (Rachel glares at him) Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what



he meant.",12
Monica," (to Phoebe) Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because



she thinks I’m good.",17
Monica," Oh yeah, she didn’t hire me out of pity, it wasn’t



so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I’m good.",27
Phoebe," Wow! And hey, it’s cool if you’re a lesbian! (Gives



her a thumbs up)",14
Joey," No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in



there.",12
Monica," …I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. (Joey starts to nod



‘Yes.’)",12
Chandler," …it was like the Algonquin kids table. (They all laugh,



but Joey only laughs not to be left out.)",19
Monica," Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom



wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them.",23
Phoebe," Oh, no, I meant that it’s weird that you only have nine



now.",13
Monica," (Looks at her nails) Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them



put… (realizes) Oh my God! It’s in the quiche! Oh My God!",25
Phoebe," Okay, don’t panic. I’m gonna go to the store,



I’m gonna get you another set of nails, no one’s gonna know, and you’re



gonna look great. (She runs over to get her coat.) Oh! Oh, it’s ‘cause



they’re gonna eat—that’s the problem.",42
Monica," Okay ah, please don’t freak out. Umm, but ah,



there’s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there’s no way to know



which one.",27
Monica," You bet that I’d screw up?! So all that stuff about



hiring me because I was good was…",18
Monica," (laughs) That’s right. My Mom doesn’t have any faith



in me! Oh, that’s hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.",15
Monica," (interrupting) No! You have lasagnas! (Storms out and an



awkward silence follows.)",12
Chandler, When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.,10
Chandler," Ah-ha, you’re not the boss of me. (She kisses him)



Yeah, you are! (She handcuffs him to the chair) Ooh, saucy.",21
Chandler," Okay. But if you don’t come back soon, (She leaves and



closes the door) there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it!",23
Rachel," Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave me



a key to Joanna’s office. Do you wanna see the list?",23
Chandler," Look, this isn’t funny! You get back here right now!",10
Chandler," (in a serious, businesslike tone) Rachel, could I see you



for a moment?",13
Chandler," Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are



on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock



me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.",42
Chandler," I did break up with her! She just took it really, really



well!",13
Rachel," And the fact that you were jeopardizing my career never



entered your mind?!",13
Chandler," It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made



it, shoot right out.",15
Rachel," Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you



get yourself out of them.",15
Chandler," No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can’t get myself right out of



them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock



me, she could be gone for hours, and I’m cold, and (Stops and looks up the skirt on a



statue behind Joanna’s desk.)",47
Rachel," Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! (Grabs the key) You



never see Joanna again!",15
Chandler," You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! (Rachel goes



over and unlocks the handcuffs) Ahhh! (He starts rubbing his wrist)",24
Chandler," No, I just always see guys doing this when they get



handcuffs taken off them. (He runs over to where his pants are hanging) Hello sweet pants!",27
Rachel," When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know



that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired!",25
Chandler," I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, I



actually did borrow your Walkman!",14
Rachel," No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know



that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were!



(She tries to drag him over to the chair, but Chandler stops her.)",42
Joey," Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear



‘cause he sucked. What else you got in there?",20
Phoebe," This used to be your room? (She nods ‘Yes’) Wow! You



must’ve been in really good shape as a kid.",20
Monica," Ohh, I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe I actually



thought she could change.",14
Phoebe," Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.",12
Phoebe," No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what



it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired



to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica.",40
Phoebe," Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would



say, ""Yeah, he pulled a Monica."" Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go,



""Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica."" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer



says, ""Yeah, that one’s outta here."" Though some things don’t change.",53
Monica," (getting up) All right, I’ll go down there. But, I’m



not gonna serve the lasagna. I’m gonna serve something I make.",21
Phoebe," Wow! My breasts are really strong. (She goes and joins



Monica.)",11
Rachel," Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back



the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office.



Now I know why.",32
Chandler," Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she



comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you were



in here. So you might as well just let me go.",38
Chandler," It still wouldn’t be clean. (Rachel makes an ‘Eww,



disgusting!’ face) All I want is my freedom.",17
Rachel," I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo



albums!",12
Chandler," Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won’t you here me?!



(Opens the door) Sophie, help me! Help me!! (Sophie stands up)",21
Chandler," I’m gonna say this for the last time. Would you please



just… (He moves his arm which opens the drawer and hits in the back of the head,



which proves his point.)",32
Joey," Wow! There’s a lot I didn’t know about vomit. (The



duck comes to the door of the bathroom, quacking.) (To the duck) In a minute. (The duck



goes back into the bathroom.)",32
Joey," Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home in



the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a



few things you don’t get from book learnin’.",37
Joey," How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?",13
Joey," You wanna see what I got? (He gets up to empty out his pockets)



Okay? I’ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an



army man. Hey!",34
Joey," And a 50. (The salesman stops suddenly) Huh, these must be



Chandler’s pants.",13
Joey," Oh, I-I think I’m gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how



this bad boy turns out.",18
Rachel," I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.",11
Rachel," I ah… Oh! I’ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every



morning!",11
Rachel," I have so got it. There’s gonna be



rumors about this, there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.",23
Rachel," Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be



very generous (Holds her hands far apart) or very (In a high pitched voice) stingy.",30
Rachel," I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s



Milton Berle.",14
Phoebe," It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this



was nothing but ingredients.",15
Monica," So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make



this a success. Which would make you…",19
Monica," Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.",12
Phoebe," Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. (They both



look at her) (to Monica) She doesn’t know we switched it. (Monica nods her head



‘No.’)",28
Monica," That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don’t bite your



nails.",12
Monica," (in a sexy voice) Hello, Chandler. (Phoebe has a huge smile on



her face.)",14
Chandler, (to Rachel) I love you. (Kisses her on the forehead),10
Joey," Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she



blew up like that Vesuvius.",17
Joey," Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous



rock formation.",13
Joey," Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.",11
Monica, Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?,10
Joey," Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk



about? Vivisection? The Vas deferens? The Vietnam War?",21
Monica," Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?



(Joey is pissed)",13
Rachel," Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn’t have poppy seed bagels, so



I… (Enters Joanna’s office and sees her handcuffed to her chair wearing nothing



but a slip) Oh my word!",29
Chandler," Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just

doesn’t say ‘cool’ anymore.",16
Monica, You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!,10
Rachel," Well, I thought you liked doing it. (Rachel starts out the door

and stops.)",14
Rachel," Ummm. Oh! I’m sorry. (She grabs the box and offers him a piece.)

It’s a little old but…",18
Rachel, I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.,10
Rachel," (starting to cry) Okay, I’m sorry. (Runs out still carrying the

pizza box.)",13
Monica," God! If you’re gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and 

goes to through it out.)",17
Rachel, Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true. ,12
Joey, I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.,11
Monica," Joey, please don’t do that. I think it’s best that we just

forget about it.",15
Rachel," That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed.",11
Joey," All right that’s it, school is in session! (Exits and slams the

door.)",13
Monica," (Picking up a card from Chandler’s wallet.) My God! Is this a gym

card?",14
Chandler," Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I’ve

missed the last 1200 times.",19
Chandler," You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I like having

50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down

there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they

bring out Maria.",49
Chandler," Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra

spandex covered gym…treat.",15
Ross, You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?,13
Ross, So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?,10
Joey," Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now,

you’re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the

landlord.",31
Joey," Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.",12
Joey," Why don’t you tell me something I don’t know! (He storms out,

and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey makes an ‘Oops!’ have.)",25
Phoebe," Oh please, somebody tell me I don’t have to go to work today!",13
Phoebe," Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every

time I see him I just want to do things to him that I’m not allowed to charge for.",31
Phoebe," Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling

around with clients. And it’s against my oath as a masseuse.",23
Phoebe," No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and

umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one’s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just

makes good sense.",32
Phoebe," No, I can handle it. No, I’m a professional. (She starts to leave)",13
Monica, Wow! And you got a pedicure. Your feet are all dressed up.,12
Chandler," Because that’s the only part of you he can see when he’s on

the table!",15
Phoebe," I don’t what your talking about. (Laughs nervously and continues to

leave)",12
Phoebe, Because it’s Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!,11
Joey," Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like

that and that he’d better come up here and apologize. I’ll see you later.

(Starts to leave)",33
Joey," He said that he wasn’t gonna apologize because you guys are living

here illegally, so instead what he’s gonna do is have you evicted—I’ll see

you later.",27
Monica," Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like

you’ve never sucked before!",21
Joey," All right! I’ll try! But if I can’t, you can stay with Chandler

and I until you get settled.",19
Joey," All right, all right, all right. (Starts to leave, stops, and turns

around) I mean I’ll have to check with him first, but I’ll think he’ll be

cool with it. (Monica shoos him out.)",34
Ross," Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be

strong.",12
Ross," One more time, ""Hey, don’t you want a washboard stomach and rock

hard pecs?""",14
Chandler, No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!,10
Chandler, Okay. (They go inside) (To the guy at the desk) I wanna quit the gym.,15
Chandler," (He turns to Ross and Ross makes a ‘Be strong’ sound.) I

wanna quit the gym.",16
Chandler," (horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about

himself) I wanna quit the gym.",18
Ross," It’s okay man, be strong. (Chandler goes into the office.)",10
Ross," No! And I’m not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.",13
Phoebe," You mean the—Okay by sciatic, you mean the towel covered portion.",11
Phoebe," Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in

the sciatic area can get y’know, real (lifts up the towel) nice and tight. So umm,

tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.",41
Phoebe," Oh. (She goes to work, and her head slowly drops out of view.)",13
Joey," Please don’t kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn’t there

fault, it was mine.",14
Joey," No you can’t do that, where would the chick and the duck live?",13
Joey," Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I’m the chick and Chandler is the

duck.",13
Joey," Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I’ll do whatever you want.",13
Chandler," Yes! Yes! Most of the time. I mean, 

sure, I have my bad days, but then I remember what a cute smile I have. (smiles)",25
Chandler," Yes, I hate it here! Everything that 

you have in here is very heavy!",14
Joey," Yeah, there’s this superintendent’s dance, the Super Ball. I

don’t know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he’s 

got a crush on.",26
Joey," Well, he’s too shy, he doesn’t thing he’s good enough to

dance with girls yet.",15
Rachel," Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that…garbage chute.

(Starts to cry)",13
Chandler," No, I almost did, couldn’t leave Ross there without a spotter!",11
Rachel," Oh, umm, I was just y’know working out and umm… Oh,

that’s it.",13
Chandler," We’re doomed. Okay, they’re gonna take 50 bucks out of our

accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?",23
Ross," Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at

the source.",18
Phoebe," Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.",14
Phoebe," No, I know! I-I’m sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna

throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.",25
Monica," Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract

yourself.",12
Joey," Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I’m doing something exciting and I

don’t wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y’know try to thing of other

things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!",35
Joey," All right, I’m here, let’s ahh, get this over with.",10
Joey," Whoa-whoa, don’t we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like

ahh, get really drunk?",15
Joey," No, it’s okay, but if I’m Marge, my breasts are coming out my

back.",14
Joey," Come on Treeger, don’t say that. You just ahh, you just need more

practice. Here, come on, let’s ahh, let’s try it again. Come on. (they start

dancing again) Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y’know,

I’m not really that comfortable dancing with a—(Treeger throws him) We-he!! Hey!",54
Joey," Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time. (He walks into the kitchen and does a

little dance step on the way.)",21
Joey," No, I’m not! And it wasn’t a hop it was a pas de 

bourree. ",14
Monica, (laughing harder) You know the words! You are so into this!,11
Joey," All right, well maybe I’m enjoying it a little bit. I mean I’m

getting pretty good at it.",18
Joey," Hey-hey, hold on, this isn’t some kind of like girly dance. All

right, it’s like a sport, it’s manly!",19
Phoebe," (thinking to herself) Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay,

slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little… Oh no—wait no, no!

No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick’s

pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that’s working.",51
Phoebe," (thinking to herself) Chandler’s knees. Chandler’s…

ankles. Chandler’s ankle hair. (notices the clock) Oh no. (to Rick) Okay, you’re

all set.",21
Phoebe," Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you’re a

client, I can’t ask you out, even though you give me y’know, the feeling.",27
Phoebe," Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn’t what it looks like,

‘cause Rick is my ahh, husband.",19
Ross," No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.",11
Phoebe," Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started

making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.",32
Phoebe," It’s so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!",11
Phoebe," I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next,

y’know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these

policemen, thought I was a whore too. It’s been a really bad day, whore wise.",41
Joey," (To Mr. Treeger) So you ah, ready for our last practice?",11
Joey," I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.",14
Joey, Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?,10
Monica," (to Joey) Joe, 

I-I don't think a four-letter word for ""ship"" can be ""ship"".",14
Joey," (looks and grins at 

Monica) I thought it was a freebie. ",11
Ross," (picking up the slip of paper) Hello! What's

this? Oh right its that girl's phone number. (Rachel ignores him) Yeah-yeah, there it is,

just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. (He holds it so that Rachel can see it, she

continues to ignore him) It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number,

but...(Rachel still ignores him) Whoa! (Throws it in her lap) Whoa-whoops, I almost lost

this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it. (He waves

it in front of Rachel's face. Then suddenly Phoebe has to sneeze and Rachel quickly grabs

the slip of paper and gives it to Phoebe for her to sneeze into.)",121
Chandler," Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty

girl, the pretty--she's pretty.",10
Monica," Just go up to her and ask her out.

(Chandler laughs) Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?",19
Ross," Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's

why I'm so glad I found Amanda.",13
Rachel," Ross, you guys went out once. You took your

kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.",19
Ross," All I'm gonna say 

is, finally, it's nice to be in a mature relationship. ",14
Rachel," You know, the 

world would be such a better place if that actually was all you were 

gonna say. ",19
Monica," Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play.

You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.",17
Phoebe," (in a nasally voice, from her cold) But I'm

unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. (She

puts her shoe on the table, and it's horribly decorated) Pretty, huh? (Sneezes)",39
Chandler," All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get

shot down. Any advice?",13
Chandler," Wish it! (To the woman, Kathy, he likes)

Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say

that?",27
Chandler," Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on

a limb here.",13
Chandler," Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out

a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger

mouth.",26
Phoebe," Before I start, I just wanna say that umm,

I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the

last verse of Pepper People. (Starts to sing) Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they

feeding you? (Stops singing) This chick sounds good. (Singing) Smelly cat, smelly--(stops

singing) Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.",69
Chandler," Mine too! Did 

your dad also make you watch the Mr. Universe contest?",13
Chandler," 
Well, me neither. (Kathy laughs)

Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this

afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...",23
Chandler," So ah, Joey tells me you two met in

acting class.",11
Chandler," That's a good thing actually, because ah,

he used to have me rehearse with him.",15
Phoebe," (singing, drunk) My sticky shoes, my

sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey. ",20
Phoebe," It's fun, God I love how sexy I am. (Coughs

really loudly.)",12
Joey," Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to

by hamsters.",11
Phoebe," Well, I think it's great that the medical

community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.",16
Chandler," She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up

all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what? ",18
Ross," Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now,

`cause he's so in love.",12
Monica," (turning around and doing that, ""I'm

making out with someone,"" thing with her hands) Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love

you! Oh! (She turns around and sees Gunther staring at her and stops suddenly.)",35
Phoebe," So, I need to write some depressing stuff

to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.",26
Monica," Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having

to live on the streets when you were 14?",18
Phoebe," Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the

time my hair did that ""Woo-hoo"" thing.",15
Ross," Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe

the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep,

I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little ""playing""

ourselves.",40
Rachel," (entering, with a guy) Hi guys! This is

Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.",17
Monica," So, did you play in college? (She points to

his NYU Soccer (football for the rest of the world) sweatshirt he's wearing.)",22
Rachel," Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High

School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your

Commodore 64.",24
Rachel," Okay. (He starts to leave, and Rachel grabs

him and gives him a passionate kiss.) I'll miss you.",18
Rachel," I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to

finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet

he's never set foot in a museum.",32
Ross," Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a

class trip or something.",14
Rachel," Y'know what else is really great about him,

oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?",24
Monica," It's this dumb thing that Ross made up

`cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without

actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the

first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.",57
Ross," Well, I'm gonna go get ready, (Gives Monica

the fist thing.) for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.",20
Phoebe," Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in

one hour. Hey, (clears her voice and in her normal voice) you guys should come hear me,

ooh hear me. Ooh, (tries to sing) My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy

phlegm!",42
Ross," (she lets him in) Okay! (to her son) Hey

Tommy.",10
Chandler," Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She

doesn't hear him and keeps running, Chandler starts chasing her as the theme to The

Mod Squad starts to play. First, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed

on him as he runs by a hot dog vendor.) Kathy! (He keeps running and gets tangled up in

the leashes of five dogs, in desperation he throws his paper.) Fetch! Fetch it! (He frees

himself and resumes the chase) Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! (He now trips and falls into a pile of

garbage, he tries to get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his

mouth. He gets out of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods

of a couple of cabs.) Kathy! (He jumps in front of her and out of breath he says) Kathy.",145
Monica," Oh come on! You're making it sound worse

than it actually was.",12
Phoebe," Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying

to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.",21
Chandler," (entering) Okay. You were right. I'm in

love with Joey's girlfriend.",11
Chandler," I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't

get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad

person. I'm a horrible person. (he waits for a reaction, when he doesn't get one) No

you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!",51
Monica," (sneezes) Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught

your cold.",10
Phoebe," You mean you stole it! (Monica sneezes

again) Don't cover your mouth when you do that!",16
Joey," Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got

drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.",19
Chandler," (uncomfortable) 

I gotta go. I gotta go meet some friends. (leaves)",11
Chandler," 99...100! Ready or not, here I come! (He

opens his eyes and sees that the chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) All

right, let's go over the concept one more time.",36
Joey," Hey guys. (to Chandler) Listen uh, you wanna

get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?",16
Chandler," Y'know I had a big meal on Monday,

y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.",19
Joey," Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we

started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think

it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?",40
Joey," Good, and hey! My treat. (He turns to go into

his bedroom then stops.) But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?",23
Monica," (lying on the couch suffering from her

cold) Ross isn't here.",11
Rachel," Oh. (She tries to walk away from Josh, by

he keeps holding her) Stop it!",15
Rachel," Yeah! (Monica gives a sarcastic thumbs up)

(Josh leaves) I am soo gonna marry that guy. (looking in her wallet) Ohhh!",21
Phoebe," (entering) Hi! It's me. And soup. (to

Rachel) Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.",21
Phoebe," (to Monica) Here, now I don't eat chicken,

so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really

just... noodle water. ",27
Phoebe," (picking up Monica's used Kleenex and

putting some in her pocket.) Sure.",12
Phoebe," But, I need your germs! I want my cold

back! I miss my sexy voice.",15
Chandler," Y'know what I think it is? It's the

fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my

father in fishnet stockings.",28
Joey," (to Kathy) I'll be right back. (to Chandler)

What was that?",11
Joey," Kathy was being really nice and you just

walked away. I thought we had a deal.",16
Joey," I want you to like her! But if that's too

damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.",22
Chandler," Okay, what do you saw I go over there and

say how much I like her? (Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her

much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the

moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in

love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own

damn bad luck that you met her first!!",82
Joey," Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna

tone it down a little.",13
Monica," I still have a 

fever? Are you sure that thing's working right?",12
Ross," (entering) Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just

dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old

enough to drive. (to Monica) So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?",39
Rachel," I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could

bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.",23
Ross," At least I know she's not going out with me

to get into R rated movies.",16
Rachel," Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a

minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.",21
Monica," (interrupting) You have nothing! You're not

even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!",19
Rachel," Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At

least he bought me something with it! (Shows her, her ring)",21
Monica," That's mine!! Now, would you both please

start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!",17
Ross," Here. (Hands her, her cough drops) (to

Rachel) At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.",17
Phoebe," (singing) Parading goats are parading.

Parading down the street. Parading goats are parading, leaving little treats. (to

Gunther) Does it even work without my sexy voice?",26
Joey," (opening the door wearing nothing but a sock,

and holding a dart board over the `Little General.') Hey! (Chandler turns down the TV)

Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?",36
Phoebe," (singing) And I'm still waiting for my

paper mache man. Thank you my babies.",14
Joey," (to Chandler) Hey, we should have a 

contest. Yeah. See who can bring home the most beautiful woman.  ",18
Chandler," That's a good idea, Joe. We could call 

it life. (Joey gives him a confused look.)",16
Monica," But look--I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back 

with the money I make from that. ",18
Rachel," Aborigine! Oh, no, I tried that already.  

(laughs at herself)",10
Monica," No, but I made a widow cry! 

(sarcastically to herself) See you in hell!  ",14
Rachel," Oh, so it's a card but it's also a 

poem-holder. (Joey points to Rachel as if she knows what he is talking about.)",23
Phoebe," Fine! Enough is enough! (Phoebe goes into the living room.) Hey, widow? ",12
Chandler," (entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy

naked! It was like torture!",18
Ross," Y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a

big surprise.",16
Chandler," It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it’s bad

enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I think

she knows. Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like

energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen

her naked. I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her

body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she’s smooth!

Smooth! (leaves)",93
Chandler," Goin’ out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So

things didn’t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.",19
Joey," No, things are fine with Kathy. I’m having a late dinner with her

tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.",21
Joey," Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by

myself! (Laughs)",16
Chandler," Well, I’m upset—for you. I mean, having sex with an endless

line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can’t believe he just

sad that.)",28
Joey, What is the big deal? It’s not like we’re exclusive.,10
Chandler," Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But

Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that

she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you.",36
Joey, You got all that from the back of her head?,10
Chandler," All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y'know?

Make a choice, pick a lane.",19
Phoebe," (singing) ""Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair.

Swinging with the greatest of ease…"" Darn it! Now, I don’t know who to

get to the next verse.",28
Ross," Oh, you could just go uh, ""greatest of ease… (plays air

guitar) BAH-bah-bha-bhannn."" Then go right into it.",18
Phoebe," Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about

‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’",13
Ross," Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in

college. I mean that’s-that’s when I really found my sound.",25
Monica," Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth

it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.",25
Monica," He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every

allowed to hear, ""The Sound.""",19
Ross," Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven’t played in so long, and-and, well

it’s-it’s really personal stuff, y’know?",18
Ross," No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in—No, yeah,

okay. (Runs out.)",17
Rachel," So who wants to get some dinner with me 

later? I really wanna try that new Italian restaurant. Supposed to be really 

good. Saw a lot of Chinese people eating in there. ",32
Rachel," Remember you said some restaurant must 

be really good because you saw all these Chinese people eating in there?",19
Rachel," Oh. Well, I still wanna go. Who wants to 

come? ",10
Joey," Oh, I can't. I got two dinner dates 

tonight, so (takes a bite of his sandwich) I gotta get ready. (leaves)",21
Monica," Oh sorry honey, but we (her and Phoebe) 

got to prep that catering thing for tomorrow.",16
Rachel," Oh, that's right. (sits down) I wish I 

was one of those people who could eat in restaurants alone. ",19
Monica," You should try it. It's a really good 

thing to do. ",11
Rachel," I just think I'd feel really 

self-conscious, y'know? Like I was on display or something. ",15
Phoebe," Nah, I was on display once. Nothing

like eating alone. ",10
Rachel," At dinner. It was so liberating! Y'know, 

I don't need people around to have fun. I'm fun. I'm a fun girl! ",21
Chandler," Are you a naughty girl? (Both Monica 

and Rachel stare at him.) (On receiving their stares) No, just fun. Fun. Good. 

Fun. ",22
Chandler," Although I must say that I totally 

judge any woman I see eating alone.",14
Ross," Here we go. (Plays one note) Y’know, I’ve-I’ve never played

my stuff for anyone before, so it’s important that-that you understand it’s

about communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Y’know, umm, you

should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That’s what

I’m…",47
Monica," (At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, umm… terrific.",11
Ross," Wow! Thanks, you guys. That’s uh—ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you

another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I’ll be

right back! Okay? (Runs to fetch them) This is so nice, I’m—I am so…

(starts to break up and leaves)",47
Rachel," Oh, I can’t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.",13
Phoebe," What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus

it’s just, it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear.",26
Chandler," Yeah, I know what you’re thinkin’! Yes, yes, your breasts

are just as firm and juicy.",16
Chandler," Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.",11
Chandler," No-no, he’s not back yet, but he’ll be here any minute. So

uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?",22
Chandler," I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) …of the

boat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.",24
Joey," (on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, it’s me. Listen Casey and I

were on our way back and had a little car trouble.",26
Joey," We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some

transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I’ll be there as

soon as I can.",34
Joey," ‘Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about

to—(he stops talking suddenly)",17
Joey," Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more—(his time runs out for

real)",17
Chandler," (to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. He’s running a little late, he

says he’s sorry.",15
Chandler," So I guess it’s just uh, you and me then.",10
Chandler," Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don’t make my tail too poofy.",11
Chandler," Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through

his hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Y’know who also has

great hair is Joey!",30
Chandler," (jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phone’s making

sounds! (On phone) Hello!",16
Joey," Listen uh, I’m really sorry, it looks like I’m gonna be stuck

here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the

transmission wasn’t there!",35
Joey," Yeah, it must’ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit

a dog.",16
Joey," Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.",10
Chandler, Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.),10
Chandler," Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here’s what we do, we-we forget it happened.",11
Chandler," Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we’re unhappy

forever. Sound good?",14
Chandler," I have to; he’s my best friend, and you’re seeing him.",11
Chandler," (interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Don’t! Don’t! See-see,

you’re getting me confused, I’m starting to yearn. ",13
Chandler," Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against

the door.) Are you still out there?",19
Ross," (His voice is altered to sound like a computer.) Electrifying. (He plays

the sound of a ticking clock.) Emphatic time-time-time…",20
Monica," (to Rachel and Phoebe) Y'know, there’s a Starbucks about

three blocks down.",12
Phoebe," (pushing Monica back onto the couch) It’s so inspired! Look at him!

Look at him go!",16
Phoebe," I can’t follow Ross! It’d be like those bicycle ridding chimps

that followed The Beatles. No.",16
Phoebe," Oh my God, he’s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give

anything to not be appreciated in my own time!",23
Joey," Aww man! I can’t believe I locked myself out again! (He knocks on the

door.)",15
Chandler," Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to

reveal a fully furnished apartment.)",19
Joey, (rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?,13
Chandler," Well, I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nice

for my friend.",16
Chandler," Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. (He goes over and

presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing

the TV.)",25
Joey," (very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That’s the dream!

Man, how did you afford this stuff?",20
Chandler," Well, y’know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.",11
Joey," Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.",10
Joey," Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey

listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I’m

gonna do that.",32
Joey," No-no-no, I think I’m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She’s

pretty cool.",14
Joey," Y’know what I think? I think somebody’s got a little crush on

Casey. How ‘bout I fix you two up? What do you think?",24
Chandler, That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!,12
Phoebe," Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!",10
Ross," Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don’t want to

play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?",24
Phoebe," Yeah, I-I can’t—I mean y’know I was trying to be really

y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just—I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift.

I…",27
Ross," See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music.

Y’know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I…

I won’t play anymore.",32
Phoebe," Oh no. No-no-no, don’t do that! How could I live with myself if I

knew I was depriving the world of your music.",23
Monica," What are you doing? He is cute and he's 

a doctor.",11
Rachel," What-what? You are the one who told me 

how important it is to spend time alone. I can't just go out with that 

guy when I have plans by myself. Wouldn't be fair to me.",35
Monica,"  So basically you're saying you 

don't want to cheat on yourself?",11
Chandler," No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he’ll

understand this?",10
Monica," You obviously haven’t screwed over a lot of your friends. (They all

look at her) Which we all appreciate.",19
Ross," No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you

kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside.",26
Chandler," Oh, don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Is

it?",12
Phoebe," Yeah! No, that’s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.",13
Chandler, God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!,10
Ross," Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.",12
Rachel," (in her head) I don't know if this is 

working out. I think...I think I wanna see other people. (closes her eyes for a 

second) Wow. Didn't see that one coming.  It's not that I don't enjoy this. 

I do. I just wanna see what else is out there. (The guy that Rachel was talking 

to earlier in the coffee house walks in. Rachel sees him.) (Out loud) Hey Guy.",70
Rachel," Oh, y'know what? It turns out I'm gonna 

be free Sunday.",11
Chandler," Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.",14
Chandler," It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot

actually.",14
Joey," Well, you’re timing couldn’t be better. She’s not my

girlfriend anymore.",11
Joey," Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind

of scene, that’s why I let people watch.",22
Chandler," Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?",10
Joey," Well, I’ve been better. But, I’m all right. So you like her huh?",13
Joey, Yeah. You know why? ‘Cause you can to me first.,10
Chandler," Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.",11
Joey," But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you’re work cut out

for you. ‘Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she’s into

some other guy. So…",34
Chandler," See uh, that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to you

about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.",21
Chandler," Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to

talking, and one thing led to another and…",22
Chandler," Look, I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do, I think

I’m in love with her!",16
Joey, Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!,14
Chandler," You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.",12
Joey," Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that

you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!",23
Chandler, Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!,12
Joey," Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like

""Well, kinda."") Well, y’know what I will not watch your TV, I will not

listen to your stereo, and there’s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that

I’m not gonna eat! You know why?!",50
Joey," Because it’s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this

apartment is empty for me! And I’m not happy about you either. (The bread maker

dings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroom

and slams the door.)",48
Phoebe," Oh my God, he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it.",10
Rachel," Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are

rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.",18
Ross," Thank you, thanks. (Sits down next to the girls) Yeah, I lost it.

Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore, (to Phoebe) would you, can you finish my

set?",28
Phoebe," After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.",10
Monica," Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.",11
Monica," Come on, no peeking! (They are leading the gang out with there hands

over their eyes.)",16
Chandler," Our eyes are closed and we’re about to cross the street. Very

good.",13
Ross," What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin'

van!",16
Monica," All right, umm, we’re not gonna really keep it this way though.",12
Phoebe," No, we’re gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a

baguette. ",13
Rachel," Oh! Oh my god! I think I lost my 

virginity in that van. ",13
Phoebe," And also, we don’t know what to do with this. (She turns on a

switch and the girl’s nipples light up.)",21
Monica," (to Phoebe) Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that

put cilantro with everything?",17
Monica," Well, I’m gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea

Reporter.",14
Monica," Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence… dozens of

people.",11
Phoebe," How could you say yes, what about our catering business?",10
Monica," Oh no-no-no, it’s only one night a week, and plus I get to take all

of you out for a lot of free dinners.",24
Phoebe," Oh, in that case—(hops up and down in joy)—Yay! (Monica looks

confused) That was me hopping on board.",18
Chandler," (entering) Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you

ready to party?",15
Ross," I don’t know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but

there’s this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was

planning to watch.",29
Chandler," No-no, I don’t think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!",12
Chandler," Kathy’s with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we

are partying with Gandolf dude!",17
Ross," Mike ""Gandolf"" Ganderson, only like the funnest guy in the world.",11
Chandler," This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!",11
Monica," All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?",13
Joey," Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with

me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?",33
Ross," Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!",13
Ross," Gandolf the wizard. (Joey is still confused) Hello! Didn’t you read Lord

of the Rings in high school?",18
Rachel," Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something.

There’s an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss…",22
Rachel," Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people

all day and…",15
Rachel," God, I am so glad you don’t have a problem with this, because if

you did, I wouldn’t even consider applying.",21
Chandler," Look you don’t understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y’know

you’re never know what’s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of

beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia! ",34
Ross," (entering) Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite

kit!",14
Joey," I have an audition, but I’ll definitely hook up with you later. Where

are you gonna be around noon?",19
Chandler," (answering it) Hello. (listens) (to Ross) It’s Gandolf!!! (on

phone) So, are you in town? (listens) (disappointed) Oh, well, well maybe next time then.

(Hangs up)",26
Rachel," Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.",10
Phoebe," Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.",13
Phoebe," Oh, okay! (reading) ""Would I go back to Allesandro’s? Sure,

but I’d have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to

my head."" (to Monica) Wow! You really laid into this place.",40
Monica," Hey, they don’t pay me a penny a word to make friends.",12
Phoebe," Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for

catering.",17
Phoebe," No-no, it’s okay. But are we sure we don’t want the waterbed?

Just y'know, because it would be silly to take it out if 

we're just gonna put it back in again. ",32
Monica," Oh my God, oh my God. (on intercom) Call me on the phone!",13
Monica," Look, I-I’m never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.",15
Phoebe," (on intercom) Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.",12
Monica," I couldn’t eat it! I had five friends who couldn’t eat it, and

one of them eats books.",18
Monica," All right, that I’ll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food

and that wasn’t it. You’re marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should

serve it with vodka and a piece of celery. ",36
Monica," Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes

good?! Where are you even from?",19
Monica," Hand me those tomatoes, I’m gonna show you what it should taste

like! Come on, hand me them.",18
Rachel," (entering Joanna’s office) Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that

interview.",11
Rachel," No! It didn’t! That’s what I want to talk to you about.

(starts to break up) Now, just to brief you… (starts to cry) I may cry, but they are

not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.",46
Rachel," Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you

believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y’know what? I

am just gonna pack up my desk, (She goes over to get all of her belongings from the desk,

which amount to a muffin and a pen) and I will be gone by the end of the day! (Realizes

she has nothing.) Well, I guess there’s no use to me sticking around ‘til the

end of the day! (Starts to leave.)",90
Rachel," Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I’m leaving! You are just a horrible

person!",15
Joey," Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you’d be out partying

with Gandel-worf.",15
Chandler," Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.",12
Joey, So what if he didn’t come! We can still go out and party ourselves!,14
Ross," Yeah! We’d meet, we’d meet total strangers, and hang out with

them!",12
Joey," We’ll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want

to party with us, dude! Come on!",19
Chandler, And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?,10
Ross," (to Chandler) Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?",11
Chandler," Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were

licking your face?",15
Rachel," Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on

an assistant buyer?",18
Monica," Okay, the owner of Allesandro’s came over to yell at me, but

instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!",27
Rachel," Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way

home, but I’m soo happy!",19
Monica, Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!,12
Rachel, How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale’s?,14
Phoebe," I don’t know, it would totally depend on her coloring and…

(realizes) You got the job!!",16
Rachel," Ohh, it’s gonna be so great! I’m gonna get to help decide what

we sell, I’m gonna have an office with walls and everything. (turns to Monica)

I’m gonna have walls!",31
Phoebe," Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding

reception.",18
Monica," Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. (Rachel

excuses herself) Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from

catering.",32
Monica," I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like

it’s snowballing, y’know?",18
Monica," It’s okay, ‘cause y'know what? You don’t really need me

for the business.",13
Phoebe," You’re the cook! With out you it’s just me driving up to

people’s houses with empty trays and asking for money!",21
Monica," All right. But umm, I-I-I’ll pay you back all the money you

invested, and you can keep the van.",19
Phoebe, For what? I can’t believe this! I gotta get out of here. (leaves) ,13
Monica," Phoebe, wait a minute! (runs after her, leaving Rachel alone)",10
Joey," All right, so we’ll get a little coffee, and get energized, and

we’ll head back out.",16
Joey," We don’t need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to

some strangers, and uh, after this, we’ll head down to the docks and see about that

boat thing.",32
Joey," Yeah, but uh, I don’t want to be up too late, so uh, I’ll have a

decaf. ",17
Chandler," Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I

strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?",27
Joey," I can’t hear a word you’re saying, my ears are ringing so bad.",13
Ross," I’m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y’know? I used

them as mittens, I didn’t want to touch a thing in that last place.",27
Chandler," Y’know what? We’re not sad, we’re not sad, we’re

just not 21 anymore. Y’know? I’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a

comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!",39
Joey," Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my

friends.",18
Ross," And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!",18
Monica," (entering) Ohh, here you are. Y’know, I’m-I’m glad you

decided to hear me out.",14
Monica," I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up

with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower

delivery person.",35
Monica," All right, I’ve got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but

umm, I’m getting the feeling that you don’t want to deliver.",25
Monica," Okay. I’m guessing that if you don’t want to deliver, you

probably don’t want to pick stuff up either.",19
Monica," Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y’know what, it’d

be, it’d be fun.",15
Phoebe," Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let’s

plan the wedding reception. (She grabs the notebook which Monica used for her ideas and

starts flipping page after page after page after page after page to find a blank one.)

Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. (pause)

Y’know what, I want you to take the chef job.",64
Phoebe," Yeah. That’s what you really want. Yeah, I don’t want to be

the reason you’re unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really

don’t want to be the reason I’m unhappy.",33
Phoebe," Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.",11
Rachel," Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an

emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any

paperwork your way before… it happened.",33
Rachel," Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothing

about an assistant buyer?",15
Monica,"  Umm, I just wanna say, uh (reads from a 3 X 5 card) that with a

pinch of excitement, a dash of hard work, a dollop of cooperation, we can have the

recipe... (Looks up and sees everyone glaring at her) Are you gonna kill me?",46
Phoebe," Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. (Joey, with an obvious

mouth full, nods yes.)",15
Ross," 15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an Oreo and

Joey mumbles, no!)",15
Ross," Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum

upstate.",17
Ross," Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the

door, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my

mercy.",38
Chandler, Were you so late because you were burying this woman?,10
Ross," No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She

seems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours

away.",28
Chandler," How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie? (laughs, at they

all look at him) That joke would’ve killed in Albany.",22
Joey," Done! I did it! Heh, who’s stupid now? (He smiles and has cookie

remains all over his teeth.)",18
Chandler," Hey, look at this! (Holding a newspaper) They’re lighting the big

Christmas tree tonight.",14
Chandler," All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really

wanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it.",24
Rachel," Hey, y’know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate

being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it’ll be Valentine’s Day,

then my birthday, then bang!—before you know it, they’re lighting that damn tree

again. Ohh, I want somebody! (hearing this, Gunther moves in)

Y’know, I want a man!! (Gunther leaves depressed) I mean, it

doesn’t even have to be a big relationship, y’know, just like a fling would be

great.",78
Chandler, Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.,10
Rachel," Well, believe me, it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung.",12
Chandler," Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office, do you

want me to set you up?",17
Rachel," Yeah! Wait a minute, it’s been a long time that I’ve been

single. How come you never offered this before?",20
Chandler," Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy. So, I no longer

feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.",26
Rachel," Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don’t like

guys with boring jobs.",17
Joey," Is it because of the review you wrote or 

something new? (Monica looks at him.) It's the review.",18
Monica," I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I

get off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chef’s

hat. (The hat says ‘Quit, bitch’)",39
Rachel," Hey, honey! What’s the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, I

was just trying to be nice! Whoa!",19
Monica," I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they

had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs and

Monica glares at him.)",35
Monica," I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit,

and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I’ve been waiting for

my whole life.",33
Rachel," Well, wait a minute, you’re the boss! Why don’t you just yell

at them? Or, fire them?",17
Monica," I would love too, but I can’t! I mean I just can’t, you know

that I’m not good at confrontation.",20
Chandler," Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director,

I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so

he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss.",46
Joey," Hey, Mon! I’m not doing anything, why don’t you fire me?",11
Monica," That’s a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?",11
Joey," Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy

direct Burger King commercials?",19
Chandler," I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him)

Og-ee-op, I’m not asking for me, I’m… I mean… No, I’m-I’m

not gay, I’m not asking you out. I’m not-I’m not-I’m not gay!",36
Chandler," See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.",11
Chandler," Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a

fling, that might be all right with Rachel.",23
Chandler," (to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name.",11
Chandler," Oh well, that’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to

stay, but sure!",16
Chandler," Well, I don’t really know what that is, but 

that's a pretty nice jacket.  (Mike takes it off and hands it to Chandler.) 

Kind of like that tie too. (Mike takes off his tie and hands it to Chandler. 

Then he immediately starts unbuckling his belt.)  Keep your pants on man!

",51
Phoebe," Hey! You guys, I’m writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want

to hear it?",16
Phoebe," (singing) Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey!

Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the dreidel, Rachel!",20
Phoebe, I know but it’s so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!,12
Joey," What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail.

Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.",17
Phoebe," All good, thanks. (to Rachel) Do you maybe have a nickname have like a

nickname that’s easier to rhyme?",19
Phoebe," Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?",10
Chandler, (to Rachel) Have I got the 50 guys for you!,10
Chandler," Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing

themselves at me! They’re buying me drinks! They’re giving me stuff! (to Joey)

Knicks tonight?",29
Chandler," Y’know what, I’m gonna uh, play the field just a little

more.",12
Chandler," (pause) Yes. (to Rachel) Okay, there’s this one guy, Patrick, I

think you’re gonna like him, he’s really nice, he’s funny, he’s a

swimmer.",24
Chandler," Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit

cards.",14
Chandler," See, I’m not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?",10
Monica," (getting up) All right, I’m gonna go to work. Does anybody have a

problem with that?",16
Joey," Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!",10
Joey," Oh, what are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?",10
Monica," You bet your ass, I’m gonna fire you!  See you 

later.",11
Ross," Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.",11
Ross, You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?,13
Ross," Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decide

between the two of them. Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a

two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this

other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y’know she’s, well

she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s not

fun.",65
Phoebe," If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?",13
Ross," Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know? She lives so

close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that

was—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding,

she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist.",52
Phoebe," Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?",11
Joey," Hey, what happened to your fancy chef’s jacket? (sees there’s a

burn spot on it)",15
Monica," They baked it. I can’t take this anymore. I’m gonna call a

meeting tonight, I’m gonna fire you tonight.",19
Joey," You got it! Oh-oh! (He starts patting the burned spot, which just happens

to be over her breast.)",18
Monica, Thanks. (Joey’s still patting the burn spot) I think you got it!,12
Rachel," Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this

could maybe turn into something serious.",21
Chandler," Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I

thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.",20
Rachel," Well, y'know, possibly. (pause) You didn’t tell him that, though?

Right?",11
Rachel," You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell

the guy that!",17
Chandler," Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just

looking to get—oh I see.",19
Rachel," Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting

out on the first date—oh, he’s so gonna get the wrong idea.",27
Joey," Yeah. Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey. Since

I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work

nickname.",30
Joey," (opening an envelope) There’s like-there’s like 300 bucks in

this one!",11
Monica," Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials?

Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is

nobody writing these down?",31
Monica," Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like

you did the other night?",19
Monica," Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here’s the

thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, (quietly) tried really hard to create a positive

atmosphere…",30
Monica," (louder) A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. (She

holds her hand over her head as an afterthought.) From now on, it is gonna be my

way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! (Joey looks at

the money he’s holding, and doesn’t speak up.) Hey new guy! I said, does anybody

have a problem with that?!",66
Joey," I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there

with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking,

""Wow! It’s been a long time since I had… (tries to do the math in his head,

but can’t) 327 + 238 dollars!""",55
Monica," Joey, we had a deal. That-that’s why you’re here! I’ve

got to fire you!",14
Joey," And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don’t fire me,

instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they’ll start listening to all the nice

things I’ve been saying about you.",35
Joey," Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.",13
Phoebe," So! Ross doesn’t really decorate his tree with

floss, but you don’t hear him complaining do you? God! (Phoebe hits her guitar which

wakes up Ross with a start.)",29
Ross," The one with the cat. I gotta go, I’ve got another date.",12
Ross," No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a

different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn.",29
Phoebe," Well look, you don’t really like the one from uptown and

you’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end

them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your

way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you’re

done!",63
Phoebe," Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.",12
Rachel," Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not

tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?",24
Rachel," You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a serious

relationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!",23
Rachel," Y’know, you should never be allowed to talk to

people!",10
Rachel," Oh! See just I’m right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being

alone, sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)",25
Chandler," Well, y’know, you’re-you’re gonna meet somebody!

You’re a great catch! Y’know when I was telling all those guys about you, I

didn’t have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)",35
Chandler," Oh, it doesn’t matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey,

y’know what, I’ve got two tickets to tonight’s Rangers game, you wanna come

with me?",28
Chandler," Well, actually it’s a hockey team, so it’s angry Canadians

with no teeth.",13
Chandler, So there is no good time to ask that question.,10
Monica," I need more swordfish. (to one of the assistant chefs) Can you get me

some more swordfish?",17
Monica," Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I’m cold!

(She spills something.) And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out! (the door

opens)",28
Monica," (starting to cry) I’m a good person. And I’m a good chef, and

I don’t deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y’know what, if you want me

to quit this bad, then all you have to do is…",40
Joey," (interrupting) Hey! Chef Geller! Y’know that little speech you made

the other day? Well I got a problem with it!",20
Joey," You bet I do! I just ah, wasn’t listening then, that’s all.",12
Monica, Well if you want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!,11
Monica," You bet your ass I’m gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get

out!! (Joey leaves) All right! Anybody else got a problem? How ‘bout you Chuckles?

You think this is funny now?",34
Monica," How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh?

You think it’s funny now? ",16
Monica," Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, (to the kitchen worker from

earlier) And you! Get the swordfish! (to another assistant chef) And you! Get a haircut!",28
Ross," (waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting

next to him)",15
Ross," Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?",13
Joey," Well I guess I should’ve thought about my wife and kids before I

talked back to chef Geller!",18
Joey," Yep! Looks like it’s gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon

house this year.",15
Phoebe," So, umm, this is a very special holiday 

song that I wrote for some very important people to me. (mouths to the gang 

""That's you guys"".)    ",26
Rachel," What the hell is that?!! (to Monica)

What the hell is that? Is that you? (Monica nods her head no, and

Rachel realizes what is making that sound.) Ohhhhhhh! (storms

over to Chandler and Joey’s with Monica in trail.) ",39
Rachel," (angrily) BACK OFF!!! (She starts banging on

their door.) Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up,

get up, get up, get up!!",28
Chandler," Well the vet seems to think that’s

she’s becoming a rooster. (The rooster crows.) We’re

getting a second opinion.",19
Ross," Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the

morning?",11
Rachel," Well, I’ve been up since six. Thanks to somebody’s

dumb-ass rooster.",11
Phoebe," You guys you really should get rid of those

animals. They shouldn’t be living in an apartment.",17
Rachel," Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives

and cookbooks around…",11
Phoebe," All right. I’m gonna go to the fertility

doctor and um, see if I’m ready to have Frank and

Alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus.",25
Phoebe," Oh, they’re just gonna umm, look to see if

my endometria layer is thick.",14
Joey," She’s mad because I know today’s her

laundry day and that means she’s wearing her old lady

underpants.",18
Monica," I just—I can’t believe that you think

that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.",20
Chandler," Well… we-we do. You can only eat

Tic Tacks in even numbers.",12
Chandler," (to Rachel) And you… Ross, I believe, if

you check Rachel’s bag you will find a half-eaten box of

cookies in there.",22
Ross," (He does so, and finds a half-eaten box of

cookies.) You’re good. (Tries a cookie.) These are not.",18
Joey," Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?",10
Chandler," Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every

item in that bag.",13
Chandler," Well, we used there’s up last night

making scary faces.",10
Chandler," All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it

up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.",15
Monica," That does not mean you know us better, I-I want

a rematch.",12
Rachel," Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery

questions, real personal questions.",11
Ross," Oh sure, ""Ross will do it!"" It’s

not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.",22
Phoebe," Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick

this morning.",13
Phoebe," Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital

or a big box under the stairs?",16
Phoebe," That’s it! 25 percent? That means

that’s it’s like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!",17
Phoebe," Okay, well y’know what, don’t worry

you guys, ‘cause I’m-I’m gonna do this as many

times as it takes to get it right.",23
Phoebe," Whoa!! That—okay, that’s a lot

of pressure on me and my uterus. (to Dr. Zane) So, well okay, so

is there—is maybe is there something that I can do

y’know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?",39
Monica," How's the test

coming? (Monica tries to look over the

gameboard)",11
Monica," Sorry....you freak! (walks into

the kitchen where Joey, Chandler, and Rachel are sitting at the

table) You guys! Do you realize that any minute

now, Phoebe can be pregnant?",29
Rachel," I know! I know, it’s such a huge,

life-altering thing.",10
Ross," Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The

first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the

categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History,

Literature, and It’s All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see

who goes first. (He flips the coin and they all watch it hit the

table and stop. Then they all look up at him, to see who goes

first.) Okay, somebody call it this time.",72
Ross," According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the

bejeezus out of him?",11
Chandler," His legs flail about as if independent of his

body!",10
Ross," Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you

both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!",17
Ross," Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and

Joey’s apartment. What name appears on the address label?",18
Phoebe," Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I’m-I’m

Phoebe Buffay, hi! I’m-I’m-I’m hoping to be your

uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we’re

doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you’ve been

there! Umm, y’know they want you so much, so when you guys

get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that

I’ll keep you safe and warm until you’re ready to have

them take you home, so… Oh! And also, umm next time you see

me, I’m screaming, don’t worry, that’s what’s

supposed to happen.",92
Ross," All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of

the guys. Ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your

category.",25
Ross," Ooh. What is the name of Chandler’s

father’s Las Vegas all-male burlesque?",12
Ross," All right, we have a tie. Luckily, I have

prepared for such an event. (He opens up an envelope and holds up

some note cards.) The Lightning Round!",28
Monica," You guys are dead, I am so good at

lighting rounds.",11
Chandler," I majored in lightning rounds. All right,

we’re gonna destroy you.",11
Chandler," Well, I’m so confused as to what

we’ve been doing so far…",12
Rachel," Okay, so let’s play for some pepper! Stop

spending my money!",11
Monica," I got it! How about, if we win, they have to

get rid of the rooster?",16
Joey," What do you have against the duck?! He

doesn’t make any noise!",12
Chandler," (interrupting) All right, hold on! If you

win, we give up the birds.",13
Rachel," What?! Monica,

no, that's crazy. There's no way we are betting the apartment.

No! (The rooster starts crowing) All right I am in! Cause either

he goes or I'm buying a coyote!",32
Monica," Rachel, I have not missed one question the

whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand. (Holds up her

hand.)",22
Monica," No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.",10
Ross," You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round

begins—stop it (Chandler stops jumping)—now. What was

Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?",24
Ross," Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get

a pencil stuck at age 14?",16
Chandler," Oh! (Whispers something in Joey’s ear

and then in Ross’s ear.)",11
Ross," Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes

her towels. How many categories are there?",15
Ross," 11, unbelievable 11 is correct. (The guys

celebrate.) All right, that’s 4 for the guys. Ladies,

you’re up. ",18
Ross," 30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the

game. The lightning round begins…now! What is Joey’s

favorite food?",19
Ross," Correct. Chandler was how old when he first

touched a girl’s breast?",12
Ross," 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.",10
Monica," That’s not even a word! I can get this! I

can get this!",13
Joey," Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I’m

sight of the room and I called it.",15
Monica," Yeah. (to Chandler) I bet you can’t guess

what color my tonsils are? I’ll bet the apartment!",17
Chandler," Oh, I would never bet this apartment.

It’s too nice.",10
Phoebe," Well, freaked. ‘Cause it turns out that

the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice’s

like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of

their eggs in my basket.",33
Phoebe," All right, I’m gonna go take a pregnancy

test, right now.",11
Phoebe," Well the doctor says it takes a couple days,

but my body’s always been a little faster than Western

medicine. ",20
Rachel," (entering from Chandler’s bedroom, I

guess, and sees the foosball table.) Oh my God! I can’t

believe you guys are actually think you’re moving in here!",26
Rachel," No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a

game!",12
Joey," You can’t just ignore the bet! It’s a

bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!",22
Monica," Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had

lost, we would’ve made them get rid of the birds. Right?",22
Monica," All right, look, I hate this as much as you,

but if it makes you feel better, it’s all your fault.",21
Monica," Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV

Guide every week!",11
Monica," It’s only been a couple of hours, so just

give it some time.",13
Phoebe," Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I’m gonna do

whatever I can to help this so, I’m just gonna y’know,

lie it your chair, (She climbs into the chair and drapes her feet

over the back of the chair.) Y'know? Yeah, good, I’m let

gravity y’know, do its jobs. I won't

get in the way. It'll be just like that time I tried to count all

the bumps on your ceiling. So..",70
Chandler," You know

Pheebs, if you sit there long enough you'll be sitting in our

apartment.",15
Joey," Oh Rach, FYI your

new apartment hasn't had hot water since Christmas.",12
Monica," Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this

box?",11
Rachel," No! Put that box down! We are not going

anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a

girl’s apartment! That is a boy’s apartment, it’s

dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It’s-it’s so

pretty! And look, and it’s-it’s purple! And I’m

telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I

have got the steady hand. (She holds out her hand, which is

shaking uncontrollably.) ",74
Phoebe," (singing) ""Are you in there little

fetus? 

                            

In nine months will you come great us? 

                            

I will buy you some Adidas.""",21
Phoebe," Oh. Oh. (Get's a

headrush) That's where all my blood was. ",11
Monica," Hey, don’t mix those up, you could really

ruin that lollipop.",11
Phoebe," All right, I will. No, I will. But umm,

y’know just remember that it’s still really early, okay

so, if it says that I’m not pregnant, that doesn’t mean

that I’m not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just

please, just so I don’t go completely nuts, just try not put

all your hopes on this.",56
Rachel," Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are

just being mean!",11
Joey," Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you

to raise the stakes!",14
Monica," Hey, we would still be living here if

hadn’t gotten the question wrong!",13
Chandler," Would you all stop yelling in our apartment!

You are ruining moving day for us!",15
Phoebe," You guys! You guys! You’re gonna have a

baby! They’re gonna have a baby!",14
Rachel," I don’t know! But maybe if we keep that

drawer shut, it’ll die.",13
Chandler," Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I

get to have sex with the star of the play!",24
Chandler," Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!",14
Phoebe," Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from

high school?",16
Monica," Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why? ",10
Monica," Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If

you could just…(Rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)…throw your purses at

it.",31
Rachel," No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge

step down!",15
Phoebe," Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty

rich people and tell them what to buy?",20
Monica," Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can’t eat are food

anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.",17
Monica," If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over

all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that’s your department now.

(She takes back the turkey leg)",35
Ross," Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good

lookin’ guy.",13
Chandler," Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst

nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!",18
Chandler," I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on

stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s

gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it’ll be like, ""So where’s your

boyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester?"" And she’ll go, ""No-no-no,

it’s Chandler."" And he’ll go, ""Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!""",52
Joey," Chandler, look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job, just

‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. I mean

just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean

it’s gonna happen with them.",41
Joey," All of these people were in movies 

together. It's much different with plays.",13
Chandler," You guys were just in acting class 

together and she slept with you.",13
Joey," Acting class is a lot more like a movie 

than a play. Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on

stage, was it like really hot?",33
Joey," Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are

actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long

as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes

away, that’s when you’re in trouble.",50
Joey," Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever

had chemistry on stage?",19
Chandler," So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?",13
Ross," Y’know what, I don’t know how comfortable I am going to see how

hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.",23
Monica," Okay. (She does so and starts to walk towards Joey to receive her

pancakes.)",14
Joey," No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which

flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin’ closer.",25
Chandler," Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals,

muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain

are the same thing. Please eat, because Joey opened up 

everything.",32
Joey," Listen also we’re uh, we’re watching the game here Saturday

night, if people want to come over.",17
Monica," Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.",11
Monica," (laughs) Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.",13
Phoebe," Oh. (Joey flips the pancake and Phoebe catches it and throws it on her

plate.)",15
Rachel," (on the phone) Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old

woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it! (Pause) I’m telling you

I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I

am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you

get this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah

really need to talk to you.",88
Rachel," Hi, I’m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?",11
Rachel," No-no, that wasn’t me! (To Joshua) Well, we should get started. Let

me show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry.",27
Rachel," Oh-oh, sorry, it’s this way, it’s this way. (Motions to the

correct way.)",13
Chandler," I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them.

Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey

told us what this means!",31
Ross," All right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was

some sexual chemistry between them.",17
Chandler," Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!",10
Ross," Here she comes. Don’t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don’t

be…y'know you.",14
Chandler," Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly

you’re having sex with him.",17
Chandler," Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!",14
Chandler," Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you’re

up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing.",18
Chandler," Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying

this!",13
Rachel," I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over

today, and I got to dress him up all day!",25
Rachel," Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them

together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never 

realized

it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.",38
Monica," Yeah, I’ve just been fiddling around in here making delicious

treats for everyone.",13
Rachel," Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be

there.",15
Ross," Oh, whatever. (Laughs and gives Joey the thumbs up heading back to his

apartment. Joey follows him)",17
Phoebe," (getting up) Well, I hate to eat and run, but…",10
Monica," No, wait, please don’t go! I’ve got porn for you too!",11
Monica," I’m the hostess! Not those guys! I’m always the hostess! I

mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought

their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.",40
Phoebe," Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone

has to hang out in the big apartment?",22
Monica," ‘Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But

I’m-I’m done now. They’ve suffered enough.",17
Phoebe," If you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang out

here! ",14
Monica," All right then, when I’m done with this place, it’s gonna be

ten times better than that place!",18
Chandler," Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at

the new Playboy) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the Playboy behind

their backs. Chandler wonders into the girl’s apartment.) You will all be very happy

to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!",49
Chandler," I confronted her, and she didn’t deny it! (Pause) I don’t

live here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)",23
Chandler," Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak

Chewley’s…",18
Chandler," Yes! See you and I have always been like—(motions that they think

the same.) ",14
Chandler," The bartender taught me a trick 

though. (gets out some matches and lights one and then tries to remember what to 

do with it.) I don't remember it. ",28
Rachel," Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joey’s.) Oh, hey, do you

need help with that?",16
Rachel," Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler and

Joey’s.)",14
Rachel," So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out.

It’s just so frustrating!",20
Phoebe," So he’s probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you

just have to make the first move.",17
Phoebe, Thousands of times!! That doesn’t make me sound too good does it?,12
Rachel, I don’t even know how I would go about it.,10
Joey," Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say,

""Hey, how you doin’?""",19
Rachel," You know what, I’m gonna do that, I’m gonna call him up, and

I’m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practicing) How you doin’?

(Calls him) Hi! Joshua? It’s Rachel Green from Bloomingdale’s.

(Listens) Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store

today? Well, we found a wallet, and we—(Listens) the license? Well, that is a

good idea! Uh, well, let’s see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh,

belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I’ll

see you tomorrow. Bye. (Hangs up) (to Phoebe) You’ve done that a thousand times?",117
Rachel," Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.",12
Joey," Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh,

Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say

yes!",28
Joey," Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?",11
Joey," No! Forget her, man! You don’t need her, you don’t need that!",12
Chandler," Well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?",11
Chandler," She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat.

Back me up here, Ross!",21
Chandler," That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and

the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.",21
Joey," Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There’s a lot of theories

that didn’t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.",20
Rachel," Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (Tries again.) You

know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too… (Tries again.)

Umm, who likes the Knicks—(Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)",38
Rachel," Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!",14
Rachel," Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. (She puts her arm in his and checks how

they would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. (Pause) Umm, so you like

it?",33
Rachel," I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you’re

interested, just as a thank you for this week.",22
Chandler," Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry.

Y’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely

understand why you were so upset.",36
Chandler," Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y’know I-I think this is a

good thing. Y'know? ‘Cause we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on.

Y’know, I know for me—(Notices a pair of men’s pants on the chair.)

Nick’s pants?",45
Chandler," Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!",14
Rachel," I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an

extra ticket.",16
Ross," So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?",13
Rachel," He didn’t turn me down! He’s at the game isn’t he? I got

the date, I’m just not on it!",20
Phoebe, Oh did you—what did you—did you work for two days straight?,11
Monica," Pretty much. (to Joey) So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?",15
Monica," So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I’m just gonna rest

my eyes just a little bit.",19
Ross," Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?",11
Monica," Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I’m always the

hostess.",12
Chandler," I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I mean

you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with

his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I

don’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.",56
Chandler," Because, I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just called

her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and they

would’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!",38
Rachel," Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it

does not justify her sleeping with someone.",21
Rachel," Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license and

holds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in Spaceballs,

and mimic a conversation between the two of them.) Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my

wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I’m glad.

Rachel, I’d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin’?

(moves the cards close together and makes a kissing 

noise.)",85
Monica," (not wanting to be left out, picks up something) Hey umm, what’s

this?",13
Joey," (examining it) Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. (Monica drops the

sandwich)",14
Ross," (pretend fishing in the living room) Ohh, Geller’s got one hooked!

Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! (Swinging the rod back and forth) It’s the

classic struggle between man and—(swings the rod and knocks over a lamp.) Someone

knocked over a lamp.",45
Joey," (going over and picking up the rod) That’s all right. Hey you guys,

you know what’s going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets

me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, ""Joey, what are you doing with

your life?"" stuff. I can say, ""Well, I’m doing a movie with Charlton Heston

dad. What are you doing with your life?""",70
Chandler," You don’t have to stop having fun just because I’m here.

Kathy didn’t cheat on all of you. (To Joey) Well, except you. (They hug and Chandler

goes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)",38
Monica," (to Rachel) You know what is so sweet? 

Those birds have not left his side the whole time. ",18
Monica," Hey, Joey, I don’t think that you should leave Chandler alone. I

mean it’s only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing

next week?",31
Joey," Look, there’s nothing I can do for him right now, he’s still in

his sweat pants, that’s still Phase One. Y'know? I’ll be back for Phase Two, I

would never miss Phase Two.",33
Rachel, How does going to a strip club help him better?,10
Joey," Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.",12
Chandler," (opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Would

you give me one minute!! Please.",18
Rachel," Um-hmm. (Joshua turns to look in the mirror and leaves Rachel staring at

his ass.) There we go. There it is.",21
Rachel," Oh, okay. Uhh, well let’s see. (Grabs his hand.) You’re

about—well uh, this one is large. And this one—(Grabs the other hand.)",22
Rachel," Hello. (Joshua leaves the room.) (to the 

mannequin) Damn you!",10
Rachel," So? (She puts her hands in his, totally forgetting about the gloves, and

hoping for something more intimate.)",18
Chandler," Y’know, I can’t believe Kathy did this too me. I really,

thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I’m never getting out of

this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the

one? My sweat pants!",51
Ross," Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take ‘em off

and we’ll have some fun.  (They all look at him.)",23
Phoebe," Wow, and I can't resist that line. 

That's why I never wear sweatpants. ",13
Ross," Catch any big fish? (Phoebe, Ross, and Monica all go over to him.)",13
Joey," Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big

tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how’s he doing?",26
Ross, He hasn’t gotten out of that chair in two days.,10
Joey," (To the rest of the gang) Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come

home. All right, uh, I’ve got to go memorize my lines. (Starts to go his bedroom) Me

and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!",42
Rachel," Ohh, it’s Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight.

But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera.

So… What are you gonna do?",34
Phoebe," I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening. ",11
Phoebe, Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.,13
Rachel," Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is—I have to meet Joshua! This

is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y’know the ""Wouldn’t it be

great if she was my wife"" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?",44
Monica," No, Chandler’s still in Phase One, and Joey’s that thing you

smell.",12
Ross," You want me to take some girl I’ve never met to the opera so you can

go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.",30
Monica," (looking out the peephole) Ohh, she’s looking down the hall. Oh!

She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can’t see people through that little hole, can

you? (Goes back to the door.) Hello!",34
Rachel," I’ll be right there! (to Ross) Okay, Ross, please come on! I

thought we have moved on! I thought we’ve gotten to a place where we could be happy

for each other! I mean was that just me?",38
Rachel," Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! (Monica opens the door.)

Emily?",14
Rachel," There’s been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that

I’m not free tonight. So…",16
Phoebe," Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.",11
Joey," (running from his bedroom) Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on

the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!",28
Monica," Oh wait, Joey, you can’t go like that! You stink!",10
Joey," Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don’t have

time! They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.",28
Rachel," Hey—whoa, slow down. (Gets a whiff of him) No, keep moving. (Joey

runs off.) Wow!",15
Rachel," Well, I didn’t see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl

in the face.",16
Rachel," The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got

there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.",29
Rachel," No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and

she was all, ""I’m Rachel Greep! I’m Rachel Greep!"" and he let her

right in. ",29
Rachel," No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal

my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can’t believe this, all I wanted was a few

hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.",51
Phoebe," That’s short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called

each other!",14
Chandler," That’s right! Where are the guys? I’m ready to get drunk and

see some strippers.",15
Chandler, She’s shhing me! It’s my phone and she’s shhing me!,10
Monica, He’s with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!,10
Ross," (in Vermont) When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet 

were wet. Who wouldn't be miserable? I'm telling you, once I got her into a dry 

pair of shoes she was a totally different person. ",37
Rachel," They’re in Vermont!! How could this happen?! (She waves her arms

franticly and hits Chandler.)",15
Rachel," How—how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! (She hits

Chandler again.)",14
Ross," I’ve gotta go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the

orchard! (He hangs up and runs out.)",19
Monica," He had to go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the

orchard.",14
Rachel," I don’t get this! She was horrible! (She hits Chandler, yet again.)",12
Chandler," Okay, I’m going to go stand over there. (Points and moves into

the living room.)",15
Rachel," I don’t care! All right, y’know what I’m just upset that

I’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—y’know what still, you do not meet

someone and go flitting off to Vermont!",30
Monica," Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.",11
Rachel," Oh, y’know, would you just for once, not remember

every…little…thing!! (Storms out.)",12
Chandler," Y’know, I knew something like this was going to happen. (He

starts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)",26
Monica, What are you doing?! Chandler! You can’t just go back a phase!,12
Chandler," Yes you can. You’re thinking about time, you can’t go back

in time.",13
Phoebe," Well, look, why don’t you just, why don’t you do your Phase

Two strip club thing with us.",18
Phoebe, Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!,12
Chandler," You don’t want to be guys, you’d be all hairy and

wouldn’t live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)",21
Phoebe," Y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and

you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!",24
Joey," (trying to act like he’s not the one that stinks.) Whoa! Yeah, what

the hell is that? What smells so bad?",21
Joey," Y’know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who

I think it is?",18
Joey," Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and

then ate some licorice. ",19
Joey," Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?",11
Monica," (coming back to the stage and sitting next to Chandler) Okay, I’ve

got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?",22
Phoebe," Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, ‘cause

I’m pregnant.",14
Monica," Very good, (getting up and sliding a One into the dancer’s hot

pants) so good.",15
Phoebe," (doing the same) I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.",10
Rachel," (joining them) Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’t

call. I mean you’d think he’d be worried about me not showing up at his club.

Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!",42
Monica," (to the waitress) When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.",12
Monica," Oh! And don’t let me leave without getting the name of that carpet

guy.",14
Rachel," Oh and Sharon, you know what? You might 

want to (motions to close her top up which she does)",19
Chandler," Ahh, come on! Y’know what—y’know what, I think I’m

just gonna go home and call Kathy.",16
Chandler," No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I’m gonna get really

drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that,

I’m gonna get so drunk, I’m gonna wanna call Janice",42
Monica, I think somebody needs another lap dance. (Motions for one.) ,10
Joey," I guess you wouldn’t believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?",14
Joey," No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I’m an actor, Joey Tribbiani,

I’m doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.",22
Joey," Yeah-yeah, I’m one of the cops that won’t work with you

‘cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I’m really sorry, but I stink!",24
Joey," Yeah. Oh, yeah. (he does so) Sorry, I'm 

really sorry. (leaves)",11
Chandler," Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress

there is quitting to teach the third grade!",20
Chandler," All right, well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.",10
Phoebe," Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y’know what, you were right, you were

right. We really weren’t great at being guys, but you know why? Because we’re

girls.",27
Phoebe, And do you know what girls are really good at?,10
Phoebe," No, listening! Sit! Y’know, maybe it would just really, really help

if you would just talk.",16
Rachel," Yeah, come on! What’s going in on in there? (Pats his chest.)",12
Monica," Yeah. And y’know, if you wanna cry, that’s okay too.",10
Chandler," Okay, look, I’m gonna have to ask you all to leave.",11
Chandler," Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay?

Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn’t picture myself with any of them.

(Sits back in disgust.)",31
Monica," They really were pretty, weren’t they? (Rachel and Phoebe both

agree)",11
Monica," Y’know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. (Chandler is

intrigued.) It’d, it’d be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so

petite.",30
Rachel," See, I don’t know, for me it would have to Chantal.",11
Rachel," Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that

dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh…",23
Chandler," Stop it! You’re killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase

Four!",14
Chandler," Where I don’t want to have a relationship ever! I just want to

have sex with strippers and my friends!!",20
Chandler," I know, I know, but you’re gonna have plenty of chances. There

are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.",25
Ross," Emily is…incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it,

I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. (Sees Rachel coming back from the bathroom.)

Oh! And you! Rach!",31
Ross," Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be

happy for each other. ",19
Ross," I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn’t quite there. Y’know, I mean the

thought of you and that-that Josh guy…",20
Ross," Joshua…guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought

of it kinda…y’know.",15
Ross," But now! I’m there! I’m totally there! I’m-I’m finally

where you are!",12
Rachel," Oh, no problem. I’m so glad I could help. Happy for you. (She

playfully punches him.)",16
Chandler," All right ladies, here’s what we’re gonna do. (Points to a

stripper.) You are gonna take off my clothes. (To another two strippers) You two,

go get the oils. (To another stripper) And you just constantly scream at the top of your

voice, ""Chandler’s the king! Chandler’s the king!""",49
Phoebe," I-I wanna be with her, (points to the stripper next to her) I like her.",15
Chandler," Oh, that’s fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.",11
Chandler," Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any

moment!",14
Chandler," What do you want from me, I’ve never met the guy. So anyway,

Rachel, I’m sorry you can’t stay, (Rachel is upset about leaving the orgy with

the cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. (The cigarette guy

starts rubbing Chandler’s back.) What are you doing? (The guy just nods) All right,

listen, I’ve got to wake up!",65
Chandler," Y'know I can't believe I'm getting my nails done. And you 

said it was going to be fun. (looks at his nails) Which it kind of is.  

Also you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!",42
Rachel," Chandler, there’s a guy right over there. (Points to the counter)",11
Chandler," That’s a mailman! That’s our mailman! (Waves to the

mailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are ya?",15
Rachel," Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you less of a guy!

(Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) That does! (Chandler

stops blowing.) What am I sitting on? (She looks and finds a huge nail.) I hate to

think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.",50
Chandler," Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?",10
Monica, Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?,13
Monica," Didn’t it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it

did?",15
Monica," They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something! How

can you not care?",16
Rachel," Well, here’s another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that

silver knob on the toilet does?",18
Rachel," Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind

actually using it?",17
Chandler," Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After it’s closed) I

can’t stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)",21
Chandler," Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before

we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality—Well, they’re all

back! Y’know? And she’s picked up like nine new ones!",36
Joey, So what are you doing bringing her here?! There’s people here!,11
Chandler," Don’t worry about it. I’m taking care of it tonight.

(Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)",19
Rachel, You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.,13
Chandler," (standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I don’t have to break

up with her this time. We’re not involved! I’m going to do a pre-emptive strike!

I’m going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes the

fridge.) ",46
Joey," Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. (They all look around

and then back at Joey.) I’m tellin’ ya!",22
Ross," No, it’s really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly

safe.",14
Ross," Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? (Imitating himself) Help! Help!",12
Ross," Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something—or

should I call it (In an English accent) football?",21
Ross," Well, we didn’t have freedom here until 1776, either so…",10
Chandler," Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were

complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.",29
Chandler," (laughs) Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very

serious relationship…",15
Chandler, Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.,10
Chandler," I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me

overseas!",12
Chandler," Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? (Thinks) Yemen.

That’s right, yes, I’m being transferred to Yemen!",19
Monica," This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and

checked every outlet. Now, four of them don’t work. Which means, one of them

has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets

that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out

which one it is.",69
Joey, (to Rachel) I bet I stopped listening before you did.,10
Rachel," Y’know, you-you also could’ve used uh, lamps and then

followed the light.",12
Monica," Yeah, well, I’m using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody

ready? Here we go. (She flips on the switch and a hum starts.) I hear something! I hear

something! Where is it? (They all start looking until Rachel realizes it’s Joey.)",42
Phoebe," Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.",14
Ross," Oh, just hold on a second. I’m watching this rugby thing on ESPN.

I don’t know what the big deal is. I’m man enough to play this sport.",28
Joey," Dude, you’re not even man enough to order the channel that

carries the sport.",14
Chandler," Y’know uh, you didn’t really have to help me pack.",10
Chandler," Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!",11
Chandler," Oh, I’m packing. Y’know I’m-I’m packing

‘cause I’m moving to Yemen tomorrow.",12
Chandler," I’m only going to pretend I’m moving to Yemen, it’s the

only way I can get rid off her.",19
Joey," Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.",12
Phoebe," Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller.",12
Chandler," (to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!",10
Joey," Nope. (To Ross) Man look at this! Ross, I can’t believe you said

you’d play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!",23
Rachel," Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.",10
Joey," (pointing to the TV) Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here.

That’s called a scrum, okay? It’s kinda like a huddle.",20
Ross," Well, you should’ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I

mean, he’s like Joe Rugby.",19
Phoebe," You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny.

(Realizes) Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.",19
Ross," Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was

like hilarious. So I’m gonna show her how tough I really am!",25
Rachel," (starts laughing, Ross stares at her) I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

You’re right, you are a tough guy. You’re the toughest paleontologist I know.",23
Joey," All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It’s not like

he’s…Chandler!",15
Ross," Look, don’t worry about me. Okay? I’ll just stay real energetic

and stay away from the ball. I’ll uh, I’ll be that guy right out of the circle.

(He points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)",43
Rachel," Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin’ at him.",10
Joey," Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy (Points), and that guy

(Points). And that one—Dude! They’re all huge!",17
Joey," Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look

bigger to you from where you are.",18
Phoebe, Whoa! (The player leaves and to Joey) I kinda liked it.,11
Ross," Okay, I know what I have to do. I’ve got to go Red Ross. (Joey and

Phoebe don’t know what he’s talking about.) Y’know, Red Ross!",26
Ross," Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and

that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all

red! Red Ross!!",38
Rachel," You…are…not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today,

and guess what happened?",14
Rachel, No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.,13
Monica," I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall

and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.",32
Monica," (picks up the electrical plans) All 

right, do you understand any of this?",13
Monica," (points to something on the plans) All 

right, does this look like a switch? (Rachel looks at it.)",18
Rachel," I don't know.  (points to something 

else on the plans) That looks like a bunny though. (both of them look at each 

other and smile.)",25
Chandler," Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.",11
Chandler," Well, we’re really not that close. (Pause) Okay, so I guess this

is uh, good-bye then.",16
Chandler," Okay. Then I guess it’s just, wait here then. (Hands her the sign

that says, Wait Here."") (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.",29
Chandler," Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.",14
Chandler, What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?,15
Chandler," No. All right, y’know what, she’s (Points to Janice) gonna

think that I’m handing you a credit card, but what I’m really gonna do is hand

you a library card.",30
Phoebe," No offence but, y’know sometimes it’s hard to understand you,

y’know with the accent, so…",15
Ross," Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!",14
Ross," (to Emily) Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you just grab me a bottle

of water? ",18
Ross," Thanks. (When she’s gone he collapses into Joey.) I-I think I’m

dying. I really do. ",15
Ross," (to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.)

Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!",23
Joey," Dude, if you go back out there, you’re gonna be Dead Ross!",12
Ross, I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!,13
Ross," No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.",15
Ross," Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!",11
Ross," I’m gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in! (Squeals like a

madman.)",15
Rachel," (noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that weren’t there

originally.) What-what are-what are these?",16
Monica," Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they’d

brighten up the place. They do don’t you think?",21
Monica," I know that there’s no hole there, I just really liked that

picture.",13
Monica," Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is

connected to something!",16
Rachel, I don’t care! The wires have come loose in your head!,11
Monica," I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it

did.",17
Monica," No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. 

For a minute there,

I thought it went downstairs.",17
Monica," Hey, Mrs. Chatracus, do you know Kenny? 

(points to the ceiling)",11
Rachel," You have got to be kid-(looks up) Wow! 

(jumps up and screams in horror)",14
Phoebe," Now, are you sure you don’t want to go see a doctor?",12
Ross," Oh no! That-that’ll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I

was great! This is a great day! Y’know what? I’m buying everyone coffee. All

right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it’s in my pocket. ",39
Joey," Uhh, look, your eye’s still popping out a little, I’m gonna go

get some ice.",15
Phoebe," Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice! (They go and get the coffee and

the ice leaving Ross and Emily alone.)",24
Ross," I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven’t done that since I

was four and I washed my dad’s Porsche with rocks.",26
Ross," Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody

nose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but, I really am. And it’s all because of

you, wonderful, amazing you.",35
Ross," It’s worth the pain. (She goes to hug him again.) Y’know what,

you know what? It’s not.",17
Chandler," Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.",11
Chandler," Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and

also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!",31
Chandler," Well, I then guess I’m going to Yemen! I’m going to Yemen!

(To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?",30
Monica," All right. The super couldn’t figure out what it did. A $200 an

hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did. I’ve had seven pretty serious

shocks. I officially give up.",31
Phoebe," See? I’m doing it. I am totally doing it. (Suddenly it stops

working.) I lost it.",16
Chandler," Hey, come on, I say more dumb things 

before 9 a.m. than most people say all day. ",17
Phoebe," I-I can’t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes

me nauseous! I’m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake—ooh! Cake!

(Chandler shrugs, and Phoebe grimaces.) No.",32
Phoebe," God! Ooh! What is that smell? It’s coming from the bathroom. Ooh!

(She goes to the bathroom.)",17
Phoebe," It’s me. It’s Phoebe. Listen there’s something in here I

want to eat, what-what smells so good?",17
Joey, Oh! Wait-wait! (Reaches inside the shower.) Is it my bologna sandwich?,11
Phoebe," Yes. Yes. Yes. I can’t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he

wants me to eat meat? I can’t eat meat!",22
Joey," Oh, wait-wait! (Reaches into the shower again.) Maybe it’s a pickle?!",11
Rachel," Well, Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the

guts to ask him out, I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.",30
Chandler," Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua, give me a

call sometime, guys like you (Pause) never go out of style—what did you throw away?",29
Ross," Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the

Cupert-Hewitt museum.",14
Monica," I don’t know how museums work in England but, here, you’re not

supposed to take stuff.",16
Chandler," (in a British accent) Anyone for more 

tea? (Ross and Emily stare at him.) No, just me then. (goes over to get some 

coffee.)",24
Monica," Hey Ringo. Every time Emily's 

around, you talk like her. Would you please cut it out?",16
Chandler," (chuckles) I think you like it. I 

think you can't resist me when I do it. You want to eat me up like a cream (in a 

British accent) ""pumpet."" ",30
Chandler," (in a British accent) Buh-bye then. 

(They all stare at him.)",11
Joey, Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.,10
Ross," Oh yeah, she’s-she’s amazing. And-and she’s so much fun.

And! Y’know what? When I’m with her, I’m fun! I do things 

like-like run off to Vermont, and-and you guys saw the doorknob. I even signed up for

helicopter classes. (Chandler is shocked.) She’s leaving in two days, I don’t

have to do it.",53
Ross," Yeah, she’s got to go back to London. But you know what? I’ve

been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and

that’s it. Y’know.",32
Chandler," Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks

that’s it.",13
Phoebe," (angered by the rubbing) Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is

totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make

it think it was getting meat, y’know? And I got nauseous.",41
Joey," Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.",11
Phoebe," That’s sweat. You throw up all morning, you’ll have that glow

too.",12
Rachel," (stopping him) Oh no-no, no-no, they don’t want you to put your

hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.",23
Rachel," Well, that’s because of a lot of…(She imitates someone picking

their nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)",20
Rachel," Huh. Well, uh, that’s uh, that’s interesting. (She goes over

and retrieves her note.)",14
Rachel," You need that, you need that too ‘cause obviously, a thief could

just tear this up. (Rips up the note.)",20
Rachel," Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we

have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.",24
Rachel," We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But 

it’s actually for Joshua. ",16
Rachel," (Starts handing out party hats.) Look, he said he’s not ready 

to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of 

work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party 

hat.)",46
Ross," Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I

aren’t going to be here. All right? I mean, she’s going to come by first to say

good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry, no

party.",47
Chandler," Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to

the living room.)",18
Rachel," Uhh, because I’m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he’s

looking over here, say something funny.",18
Rachel," Okay, y’know what, y’know what? This playing hard to get thing

is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. (Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (She

does a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.) Hi!",37
Rachel," No? Y’know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my

tongue. ",15
Ross, (interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.,11
Ross," Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15

minutes and then y’know, then The Plaza for dinner.",23
Ross," No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very

short. It’s usually, ""Surprise!"" And then, ""Oh my God, I’m so

surprised—good-bye!""",21
Ross," Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monica’s knee really hardly

and Monica winces in pain.) Oh, oh, did she tell you that 

when she was little she was partially responsible for new legislation regulating 

the strength of swing sets? (Monica does the 2-fist gesture to Ross who isn't 

even looking.) ",51
Phoebe," Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?",13
Phoebe," Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?",11
Rachel," Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?",10
Rachel," Ohh, God! Look at him, he’s so cute. I wanna go over there, grab

him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?",32
Joey," Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.",12
Joey," What? Were you like in the movie, or… Anyway, she takes off

her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.",27
Monica," Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.",12
Rachel," No! You guys can’t leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole

big thing planned!",17
Monica," Two in a row! You’ve got to use your tongues now! (They kiss

again.)",14
Ross," (stopping them) Okay, that-that’s enough! Y’know, let’s,

let’s let someone else play.",12
Joey," If you didn’t want to play, why did you come to the party?",13
Chandler," All right. I'll go. I'll go. (spins 

the bottle) Somebody loose. Somebody loose. (the bottle ends up pointing to him) 

Story of my life. (spins it again and lands on Joshua.) Story of my father's 

life.",36
Rachel," It’s okay! It’s okay! It kicked once, it’ll kick again!",10
Rachel," All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting. ",10
Phoebe," Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it.

Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder, cold blooded

murder.",22
Chandler," There’s a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away, giving the

sandwich to Phoebe.)",14
Phoebe, I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.,13
Joey," All right look, y’know how-y’know how when you’re dating

someone and you don’t want to cheat on them, unless it’s with someone really

hot?",24
Joey," All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you’re going

to do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!",28
Ross," (interrupts and the laughter stops) What 

are you doing to me?! I mean, I'm trying to get Emily out of here and you keep 

talking to her being all interesting and making her laugh! From now on,  I 

don't want you to be funny anymore. ",45
Chandler," Huh, y'know what? Rachel wants me to 

be funny, you don't want me to be funny.  From now on, I'm gonna be funny 

sometimes, and not funny others!  (Chandler walks off while Ross seems 

confused.)",35
Phoebe," Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I’m

gonna eat like, y’know millions of cows. (in a sarcastic 

tone) Mommy cows, daddy cows, baby cows..(in a serious tone) No. No, I will 

never eat baby cows! No veal!!! (thinks about it) (in a calm voice) Ooh, but 

veal.",53
Joey," Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.",13
Joey," Well, suppose until the baby’s born I laid off it. No extra animals

would die, you-you’d just be eating my animals.",21
Phoebe," Joey, I can’t believe you would do that for me.",10
Joey," Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There’s no meat in beer, right?",12
Ross," Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetizers and asked

for our check right away.",18
Rachel," No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress

wasn’t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.",24
Monica," Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can’t let—(pause), actually

I kinda want to see what happens.",14
Rachel," Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye

cheer. So okay! (Runs into the living room) Ready! Okay! Gimme an ‘E!’",25
Rachel," What do you get? (She throws her pom-poms to Joey and Phoebe and

performs a cartwheel.) Emily!! (Tries to do another one.) Emil—Whoa!! (She falls in

Chandler’s room.) Okay! So that’s me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! (Gunther’s

the only one that claps.)",42
Rachel," I’m fine! I’m fine! I’m just losing a tooth, it’s no

big deal. I have a dentist! Y’know. I’m gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me.

(She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do

now?",50
Joey," Okay, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)",11
Rachel," Oh, yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) Y’know, this bra…

Really, bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Y’know, this used to be my

bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could

talk, y’know what they’d say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently

pulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it isn’t co-operating.)",68
Rachel," Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is, this is not

how this is supposed to happen.",20
Rachel," Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought that

if I could get you here, I could seduce you.",26
Rachel," Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can’t believe this, all

this time, I liked you and you liked me!",22
Rachel," Oh no-no-no don’t say but! No-no, but’s never good! Let’s

just leave it at, you like me and I like you.",21
Rachel," Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so

you and Emily are free to go.",20
Ross," That’s okay. She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and

uh, it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so…",25
Rachel," Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.",15
Rachel, Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?,10
Ross," That’s okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just

didn’t want it to end this way, y’know?",20
Ross," Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed

that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.",27
Rachel," Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends,

asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you

don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.",37
Rachel," Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and

you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.",29
Ross, Thanks. (He starts to go inside and stops.) What photo album was it?,13
Rachel," I don’t know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.",12
Ross," Oh my God! Those weren’t albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!

(He hurries inside and Chandler is taking out the garbage.)",22
Joey," Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that’s much better. How about a

little of that smoked turkey?",18
Joey," (He starts looking longingly at the sandwich.) Oh mama! Uh when-when is

the baby due?",15
Joey," Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those

right?",17
Joey," Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must’ve hit something on the

remote.",15
Joey," No, we didn’t even pay our cable bill—maybe this is how they

punish us.",14
Joey," Maybe we shouldn’t pay our gas bill? (Stops and thinks about what he

just said.)",15
Chandler," Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!",13
Joey, (to Chandler) Why would he turn off the TV? (Chandler shrugs.),11
Rachel," All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this

while we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)",23
Joey," Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!",13
Rachel," Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh, God. (And gives it to Monica

right away.)",16
Phoebe," Ohh, I’m getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid

massage table. Y’know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table. (She

goes over and stands in front of the TV.)",36
Chandler, Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table.,11
Phoebe," Ohh! (She moves.) Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN

today.",16
Ross," Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y’know, we-we

said our good-byes this morning, so…",18
Monica, You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!,10
Ross," Well I, that’s the thing, I don’t know! I mean, whenever I

brought it up with her she said, (In a British accent.) ""This is so fantastic! Why do

we have to talk about the future? Let’s just enjoy…""",39
Monica," (interrupting him) No-no-no, don’t-don’t do the accent.

It-it really bums me out.",12
Monica," Well that's someone you should hang on 

to. You’ve got to see her again.",14
Monica," No! Y’know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land,

fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.",22
Ross," Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that

Ukrainian kid?",18
Monica," Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!",12
Ross," We said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know?",11
Monica," Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport

and tell her. You’re probably just gonna catch her just as she’s about to go to

the gate. You’re gonna call out her name and say, ""I love you!"" And

she’s gonna say, ""I love you, too!"" And you guys are going to have the most

amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.",68
Monica," Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to

heat up, and then a stewardess comes in… (Ross looks at her.) I’ve been watching

too much porn.",32
Phoebe," Why don’t take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again,

I’ll hold onto your card, okay?",19
Phoebe, Three? You guys were worried I wouldn’t even have one!,10
Phoebe," Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months

I’m going to have three full grown babies just walkin’ around inside me?! Oh!

Oh! And it’s gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!",47
Phoebe," (to Rachel) I'm going to use this a lot. 

(Rachel nods.)",11
Phoebe," Oh well, okay, hey, y’know how when you’re umm, you’re

walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, ""Oh,

that’s nice?""",28
Phoebe," Okay, yeah well, good news, you’re going to have three babies.",11
Phoebe," Oh God, I’m so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were

going to be all freaked.",20
Phoebe," No, no maybe ‘cause it’s harder to raise them, and the added

expense, and…",14
Phoebe, No you can’t quit college! No! You’re in college? Really?,10
Ross," I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.",13
Ross," That’s, that’s, that’s a big candy bar. (She’s holding

one of those huge Toblerone bars.) I had the most amazing time with you.",23
Ross," (stops her) Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm,

I’ve been thinking, I’m just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I

think I love you.",32
Rachel, What’s that song? It has been in my head all day long.,12
Rachel," Y’know who doesn’t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend

Joshua.",11
Rachel," No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.",13
Chandler," Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was

corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?",26
Rachel," I’m going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too

skinny. (As she exits, Phoebe enters.) Hey, Pheebs!",20
Phoebe," Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is

having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I

want to talk to you (Points to Chandler) about, ‘cause you work for a big company.

Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.",60
Chandler," They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get

you some free white out though.",20
Monica, Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?,11
Ross," She said, ""Thank you."" I said, ""I love you."" And she

said, ""Thank you.""",14
Chandler," Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?",10
Joey," Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!",10
Chandler," All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her,

it’s over.",15
Monica," It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves

you. And the reason why she couldn’t, is because her feelings were so strong, it

scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the

plane! Come on now go! Go! (Tries to push Ross out the door.)",62
Ross," Okay! Okay! But if she doesn’t call, it is definitely over! No, wait.

Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y’know just to she what’s going on, and,

and she says she’ll call me back, but then she doesn’t. Then it’s

over.",41
Chandler," Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn

break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.",27
Chandler, Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.,12
Joey," Rach, look. I'm going to have a kid 

someday. Okay?  And someday that kid is going to ask me if I ever turned 

off free porn. I don't wanna have to tell him that I did.",36
Phoebe," Oh this, well I’m glad you asked. (She opens the case and removes a

knife and an soda can.) Now, don’t you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an

ordinary steak knife? (She efficiently cuts it in half.) Ahh! Now, I know what you’re

thinking…",50
Monica," Phoebe, they didn’t make you pay for those knives, did they?",11
Rachel," Honey, you’re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice

just by selling knives.",16
Phoebe," No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second

part of my plan.",19
Ross," No, no, that-that, that’s all right. Umm, I’m just glad you

called.",12
Ross, Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?,13
Ross," She doesn’t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.

So I told her when she figures it out, give me a call. 

Maybe I'll still be around.",32
Chandler," Okay just so I know, when you say 

""still around"", you mean still around like you might be in a relationship or 

still around like you might have died waiting for the phone to ring? ",35
Monica,"  Oh, but it was so right. This isn’t how it’s supposed to go, there can’t be

another guy.",18
Monica," Of course there’s another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you

have to prove your love!",17
Ross," I’m not proving anything. Okay, I’m done listening to you. If I

hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never

would’ve put my fist through the wall!",35
Ross," No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!",12
Joey," Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. ‘Cause you already told her

you love her and she didn’t say it back, then she called you and told you that

there’s another guy, so yeah, go to London that’ll scare her!",40
Monica," You sat back and let him have her, you didn’t fight at all. Am 

I right?",16
Ross," I just told you, I made fun of him behind 

his back. (thinks about it) Oh I see. ",18
Monica, Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?,10
Monica," All right then, go fight for her! (sees 

the porn on the T.V. ) Woah! ",15
Monica," That could be

you and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!",17
Monica," Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don’t let her go

without a fight!",16
Ross," I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to London and I’m going to fight

for her.",14
Joey," Ross! Ross! If you’re going to the airport, could you pick me up

another one of those Toblerone bars? (Chandler nods his head no.)",24
Phoebe," Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I’m

gonna open up my own massage place and Frank’s gonna help me! And! We can work it

around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school!",43
Monica," That’s sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?",11
Rachel," Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys

used for catering and we realized…",21
Phoebe," Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need

massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the

massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know

what I’ve got?",51
Chandler, A place where no one will ever get out alive?,10
Phoebe," No! Think about it, it’s a taxi that people take when they need to

relax, it’s…",16
Phoebe," YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That’s

not good.",14
Monica," Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?",11
Ross," No, because she hasn’t come home yet. And she hasn’t been home

all night! She’s obviously staying with that other guy, and I’m the stupid moron

who spent the whole night outside her apartment! (hits a 

window of the telephone booth)",41
Ross," I just put my fist through another wall.  

Tell the guys.",11
Monica," All right. When is, when is the next flight out?",10
Monica," Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn’t show

up by then, then just come on home. Oh cause I just 

remembered that there's a girl at the restaurant that would be perfect for you.",39
Phoebe," Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks

that’s better than Relaxi Cab.",16
Joey,"  No.  (Monica looks at Joey's 

cards and pulls out an eight and hands it to Chandler.) (Joey stares at Monica.)

",20
Monica," Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! (Points at Chandler) I

was right! (Points to Emily) I’m right, right?",24
Ross," (yelling, thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine all

the way to New York.) I love you too! I’m, I’m gonna call you right now from the

phone booth! (Realizes) You can’t hear me. (Goes to make his call.)",41
Chandler," I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she

didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.",27
Joey," Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over,

gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!",22
Chandler," What, no, ""Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?""",10
Chandler," Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like

a drum.",14
Phoebe," (not amused) Ha-ha. (She sits down on the couch.) No, it’s just

I’m so pregnant that I—my guitar doesn’t fit anymore. So I thought

‘til I’m not, I’m just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really

cool!",41
Phoebe," Listen. Listen. (She starts to play and sing.) Smelly cat, smelly

cat, what are they feeding you? ",17
Phoebe," I know! I know, and I’ve only been playing for like an hour!",13
Phoebe," Oh, well, don’t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my

uterus.",16
Ross," Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.",12
Ross," Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock’s a little fast, uh, we have 17

minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?",22
Ross," I’ll be right there. (He goes over and opens the door to Carol,

Susan, and Ben.) (To Ben.) Hello! (To Carol.) Hello! (To Susan.) Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is

Carol and Susan.",32
Ross," Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so…",12
Phoebe," Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book (Holds up a

book) and found nothing! I want a name that’s really like, y’know strong and

confident, y’know? Like-like Exxon. ",33
Joey," Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?",11
Phoebe," No, I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name

starting with ""The.""",17
Joey," Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey’s your pal. Joey’s your

buddy. ""Where is everybody?"" ""Well, they’re hanging out with

Joey.""",23
Chandler," Hey, y’know what, if you’re gonna do that, if you’re

gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesn’t think so.) Oh,

come on! Chandler’s funny, sophisticated, and he’s very loveable, once you get

to know him.",39
Joey," Oh well, hey, Joey’s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if

you need him, he’ll be there.",19
Chandler," Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a

little late, but-but, he’ll be there. And he’ll bring you some cold soda, if

want you need him for is that you’re really hot.",39
Phoebe," Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey

and Chandler are great names. (They both stare at her.) But, all right, I

don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk.",36
Joey," I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to

name my kid!",15
Rachel," Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time

tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. (She’s holding two frilly,

lace nighties.)",30
Monica," Y’know what? It really creeps me out choosing other

people’s sex clothes.",12
Rachel," Sorry. I’m so exited! I’ve been waiting for this for months! I

got my hair colored! I got new sheets! I’m making him a very fancy meal. ",27
Monica," Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine

nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.",23
Monica," Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left

over at the restaurant. And then you realized if you (Points at Rachel) bitched about it,

then you (Points to herself) would stop cooking, and you (Points at Rachel) would have to

make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.",54
Monica," Why you going through all this trouble 

anyway? He's a guy. You could actually serve the potato and he'd still want to 

have sex with you.",26
Ross," Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they’re

going to the theatre together! They’re going to dinner! They’re going horseback

riding!",24
Chandler, You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?,11
Ross," Hey, they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching!

Y’know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful—didn’t

you see Personal Best?",25
Chandler, Hi! Hi! You’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.,11
Ross," How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married

her!",15
Ross, What a weird way to kick me when I’m down.,10
Phoebe," Well, it’s just y’know that something like this would never to

like The Hulk, y’know…",15
Ross," Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No.

72, Dr. Bruce Banner found… (Sees everyone staring at him and stops.) Y’know,

ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend’s a lesbian. (Leaves.)",30
Phoebe," So, I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or

Chandler.",13
Joey," Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named

Chandler.",14
Chandler," Okay, there are no famous Joey’s. Except for, huh, Joey

Buttafucco.",11
Phoebe," Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it’s like

y’know, Chanoey?",13
Chandler," Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he’ll

never be President. There’s never gonna be a President Joey.",22
Joey," All right look man, I didn’t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is

the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It’s not even a name; it’s barely

even a word. Okay? It’s kinda like chandelier, but it’s not! 

And then you put it together with Bing and forget about it!  It’s a stupid, stupid non-name! ",58
Chandler," Wow, you’re, you’re right. I have a horrible, horrible name.",10
Joey," I’m sorry man, I didn’t—I’m-I’m sorry. I’m

sorry. (Goes over and comforts him.) ",13
Rachel," Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. (They kiss.) Ahh. So, dig in!",11
Rachel," Oh I know, my God, this is so—this rice is so—I am so good.",14
Rachel," (sees the chick and the duck) Oh, yeah, I’m sorry. They used to

live here; sometimes they migrate back over.",20
Joey," (answering the door.) Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. (He brings

them inside.)",16
Rachel," Okay. So, can I serve you a little of—What? What? What? (She sees

that Joshua isn’t relaxed.)",17
Rachel," But, they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away, it

would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.",25
Rachel," Okay, y’know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I

mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment.",26
Ross," Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, ""No."" I asked

him if he wanted to sleep, he said, ""No."" I asked him what he wanted to do, he

said, ""No."" So, he’s sweeping. (We see Ben playing with a broom and a

dustpan.)",47
Ross," Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I

don’t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?",29
Ross," Y’know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.",13
Ross," Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment,

Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y’know? Say-say they’re

coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks,

they’re laughing, y’know, someone innocently touches someone else…

There’s electricity, it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me there

isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening?",67
Ross, OH MY GOD!! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!!,13
Rachel," Whoa-whoa, there’s two living rooms? God, growing up here, this

place must’ve been a real babe magnet.",17
Rachel," Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?",14
Rachel," That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?",15
Rachel," Ohh! It’s so nice to meet you. (She goes over and shakes their

hands.) Hello. ",15
Rachel," What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is

not—that’s-that’s not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see

and-and, this is a real dress actually. It’s-it’s, they’re-they’re

wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people

respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale’s, so…

And obviously in uh, in-in this case, (She grabs a pen and paper) I am going to report

back, ""USA not ready.""",84
Rachel," Well, we were going to do that after—I mean umm, next.",11
Rachel," Oh, yeah, well… Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin’

around the house. ",14
Chandler," Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.",11
Phoebe," All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?",10
Chandler," Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.",10
Joey, No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.,10
Chandler," Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?",11
Rachel," Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled

water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.",25
Rachel," No, it’s all right. I got nice boobs. (Phoebe and Monica nod there

heads in agreement.)",16
Ross," (returning from the phone.) So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she

and Susan are going to a poetry reading together! ",23
Phoebe," Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous,

sycophant. (They all look at her.) All right, so I don’t know what sycophant means,

but the rest is right.",29
Ross," Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, I am not a crazy,

jealous person.",15
Rachel," She’s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out

about Mark and there was nothing going on.",20
Monica," Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren’t jealous at all even

though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!",21
Phoebe," All right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then

’94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!",22
Monica," Look, all we’re trying to say is, don’t let what happened with

Carol ruin what you got with Emily.",19
Ross," Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.",12
Chandler," (entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?",13
Joey," Nah, you’re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good

Barney.",16
Chandler," Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay,

it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with

women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or

John Markson.",45
Phoebe," You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got

to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact—yes, (To Joey) I’m, I’m sorry. I

know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m

gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler.",51
Phoebe," Yay—oh—yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!",11
Joey," Ohh! (Realizes it was all a trick to get Phoebe to name the baby

Chandler.)",15
Ross, (To Carol) No tongue. (And gives her the thumbs up.),10
Rachel," I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate

the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!",27
Joey," Are you kidding? I love that guy! (Starts singing) Morning’s here!

Morning is here—",14
Rachel, Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.,16
Monica," Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.",13
Rachel," Monica, you don’t even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the

floor!",15
Monica," Y’know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay,

I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!",24
Ross," Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe? (Shakes his head around,

pretending like he’s jamming.)",18
Ross," Oh, I know. Y’know what, I never would’ve gotten this if it

weren’t for you. No really, when I’m with you I’m-I’m like this whole

other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love

that guy!",46
Ross," Then don’t. Stay here. Just don’t go so soon to London, just one

more day.",15
Ross," So, then you can stay as long as you want.",10
Ross," Oh no. Don’t, don’t, don’t start packing. Come on! (She

puts some clothes into her bag, and Ross throws them out.)",21
Ross," No. No, I didn’t. I didn’t want to be that guy.",11
Phoebe," Oh, yeah! You like ‘em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and

got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!",25
Chandler," Santa pants. (Phoebe still doesn’t get it.) Santa Claus’s

pants.",10
Phoebe," Nuh-uh! They’re maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby

names. (Pulls out a sheet of paper which lists who’s been naughty and who’s been

nice.) See, these names are good, and these names are bad. (Finally, she figures it out.)

Ohh.",44
Phoebe," I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the, y’know—You’re

clothes aren’t funny.",10
Monica," Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?",10
Rachel," Yeah, my mom got my dad’s season tickets in the divorce, so she

just gave them to me.",18
Joey," (examining the tickets) Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!

I could slip Woody Allen my resume. ",20
Chandler," Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up my bachelor pad for some

basketball seats!",14
Chandler," No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.",15
Chandler," (ignoring him) Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?",12
Joey," Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?",12
Joey," Oh come—look, when I was a kid my dad’s company gave season

tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of

course, he wasn’t in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!",42
Ross," (entering) Hey, guys! (They both notice his new little friend)",10
Ross," I like it, and Emily likes it, and that’s what counts. So uh, how are

you guys doing?",18
Joey," Oh-no, don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.",13
Ross," I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the

airport, it’s-it’s so great. But at the same time I’m thinking, ""Well,

I’m gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off.""",44
Ross," Nothing! There’s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here.

I mean, she-she’d have to uh, move here. She should move here!",25
Ross," I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!",10
Chandler," Because you’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, I’ve got

a carton of milk in my fridge I’ve had a longer relationship with!",24
Ross," Look guys, when I’m with her it’s-it’s-it’s like she

brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y’know?",22
Chandler," And I love the milk! But, I’m not gonna some British girl to move

in with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now.",27
Joey," All right look, Ross, he’s right. Emily’s great, she’s

great! But this way too soon, you’re only gonna scare her!",20
Joey," No! You don’t want to wreck it, you don’t want to go too fast!",14
Ross," Yeah, no, you’re right, I know, you’re right, I’m not,

I’m not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys. (Gets up to leave.)",23
Chandler," Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.",12
Monica," (entering with Rachel) All right boys, last chance for the tickets!",11
Joey," Wait-wait-wait-wait! (To Chandler) Come on! Come on, let’s trade! The

timing’s perfect, I just clogged the toilet! ",17
Chandler," Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we

can’t leave in the small apartment after we’ve lived here! Didn’t you ever

read Flowers for Algernon?",31
Joey," Yes! Didn’t you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I

didn’t read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!",22
Chandler," Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot

more than just season seats.",20
Chandler," I didn’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so

much more.",15
Chandler," No. No. We’re not gonna do that, y’know why? Because its not

an even trade.",15
Rachel," All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the

tickets?",15
Joey," Come on man, you know I’d do it for you! Because, you’re my best

friend.",15
Chandler," All right, but you can’t use that again for a whole year.

I’m in.",14
Phoebe," Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?",13
Rachel," Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she’s

the only who’s impartial, and she’s so pretty.",20
Phoebe," Oh, well, it doesn’t have a name—oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it

doesn’t have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favorite thing about trees?",25
Phoebe," Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy,

leafy.",13
Monica," You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high

card wins. What do you say?",21
Phoebe," Yeah! Here! (She grabs a deck out of her purse) Oh no, these are the

trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.",21
Joey," Yeah! Okay. (Joey picks a card.) Phoebe, you look, I can’t.",11
Phoebe, What make you think I can?! (Shields her eyes from it.),11
Phoebe," I don’t know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! (She fans out the trick deck.)

Ah-ha!",14
Rachel," Come on apartment! Come on apartment! (Picks a card.) Oh! I know queen

is high!",15
Joey," Uh-huh, not as high as…(picks a card) It worked! King!",10
Chandler," Tickets please! (Rachel hands over the tickets) That’s courtside

baby!",10
Joey," Seriously, good game though. Good game. (He tries to congratulate them,

but they pull away.) (To Chandler) What are they so mad about? They get the apartment

back!",28
Ross," Don’t be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say

it’s too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.",24
Ross," Well, so, you-you’ll get a job here! I mean, I’m always hearing

about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!",27
Ross," No, I can’t. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I

can’t leave him. Isn’t—you don’t think there’s any way?",23
Ross," No! No! I’m not! It’s-it’s-it’s perfect! I mean

it’s better than you just-just moving here, ‘cause it’s us together

forever, and that’s-that’s what I want.",25
Ross," Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who’s-who’s to say? Does that me

we-we can’t do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married

and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us.

Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I

mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn’t it?",79
Ross," Come here, come here. Uh, (He takes the earring out.) ow! Emily, will you

marry me?",16
Ross, Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!,11
Joey," Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y’know, kinda

like a peace offering.",17
Chandler," Oh yeah, that’s very nice. Plus, y’know they were free and

they’re too small.",14
Chandler," Oh. Oh, God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head

cut off.)",15
Joey," Hey, want a beer? (Hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.)

(Jumping up.) WHOA!!!!",19
Monica," We’ll discuss it, in the morning! (Slams the door shut.)",10
Phoebe," (opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.)

(Opens the door.) Okay, it was my idea, but I don’t feel good about it.",28
Chandler," Well, you’re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have

jobs, and as soon as you do, we’re switching it back! There’s nothing you can do

to stop us! Right, Joe?",32
Chandler," I don’t care, this is our apartment! And they stole—you

stole it—our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am

getting it back right now. I’m getting back right now!",35
Rachel," All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup

offer.",15
Chandler," Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can’t offer anything to us!",11
Monica," As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.",12
Rachel," Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our

apartment back?",14
Phoebe," That’s so funny to think if you’d just done that right after

the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.",24
Phoebe," Okay, scarf’s done. (It’s not really a scarf, it’s just a

bunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then, Ross and Emily enter dragging with

them Joey and Chandler.)",31
Ross," Uhh, okay, it’s uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.",14
Ross," We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.",10
Ross," (turning around.) Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys…",10
Rachel," Yeah, I-I heard. (Pause, everyone looks at each other, waiting for

Rachel’s reaction.) I think it’s great! (Hugs Ross.) Ohh, I’m so happy for

you!",25
Joey," Monica and Rachel made out. (Giggles like a schoolboy and Monica glares at

him.)",14
Chandler," Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!

Joey! Joey!!",14
Joey," (joining in, in his sleep) Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!",10
Chandler," Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? (Gunther starts to

pour him another cup.) So uh, what do you do when you’re not working here?",27
Chandler," Oh, okay, thanks. (He goes back to the couch and rejoins Monica, Joey,

and Phoebe.)",15
Phoebe," Okay, do me. I've had a certain number 

of juices. (Monica just gleefully smiles at her.)",16
Chandler," Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I’m exhausted!

Because Joey started snoring!",16
Chandler," It’s not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a

sleep clinic!",16
Joey," Look, I told ya, I’m not going to any clinic! I don’t have a

problem, you’re the one with the problem! You should go to a ""Quit being a baby

and leave me alone"" clinic!",35
Joey," Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you’ve

just had your first class!",18
Monica," Y’know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light

sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over…",27
Monica, He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.,11
Joey," I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do

it.",18
Phoebe," I still cannot believe you’re engaged! (Ross looks at her)

Just ‘cause its happening so fast; not ‘cause you’re such a loser. ",22
Monica," Ugh, she’s upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya

something! I’m not doing them this time! I don’t care if those dishes sit in the

sink until they’re all covered with—I’ll do them when I get home!",39
Ross," Yeah—oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in

London…",11
Ross," Yeah, but it didn’t fit. Well, luckily there’s a store here that

has one left in her size, but I’m the groom, I’m not supposed to see the

dress… ",29
Chandler," Oh, she’s got you running errands, y’know, picking up

wedding dresses… (Laughs and makes like Indiana Jones and his whip) Wah-pah!",21
Rachel," Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so…",12
Ross," So listen uh, I know you and I haven’t really had a chance to talk

since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.",33
Ross," I know if you were getting married I’d feel, kinda…..

y’know.",11
Rachel," Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but

I’m okay.",13
Ross," You’re great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You

just hang in there.",17
Rachel," I mean maybe you didn’t hear about a serious relationship called me

and Joshua?",14
Ross," Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn’t

realize that had become anything, yet.",20
Rachel," Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has—yeah. Oh no, those

were four great dates. ",15
Rachel," Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y’know,

emotionally, mentally, physically…",14
Rachel, I know isn’t it? It’s like I’m right there with Joshua.,11
Rachel," You are right there with Emily. And it’s y’know, it’s

kinda like…. it’s a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.",26
Ross," If like the four of us could all y’know, hang out together. Uh, in

fact Emily’s coming into town this weekend, why don’t you say we all have

dinner? Say, Sunday night?",32
Rachel," (to the closed door) Hang in there. You hang in there. (Gives him the

raspberry.) ",15
Monica, Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It’s so beautiful!,11
Phoebe," Yeah, but y’know, about have of these are gonna end up getting

divorced.",13
Monica," Oh, yes, umm, I’m here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.",15
Chandler," All right buddy, time to roll over. (Rolls him over, and discovers a

surprise) (Looking down) No-no! (Covers his eyes) No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a

clinic! You’re going to a clinic, and a pajama store!",37
Monica," Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates?

Yes! I believe she does. (Looks at the wedding dress and stops.)",27
Monica," Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming.

(There’s a knock on the door.) Uh, just a second!",23
Joey," This sucks! I didn’t know I had to stay up all night before I went to

this stupid sleep clinic! I’m so tired!",23
Chandler," Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and

Emily, and I think that’s, I think that’s really cool.",25
Rachel," Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There’s nothing to

handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn’t for me and Joshua.

Y’know, they’re not gonna get married anyway!",35
Rachel," Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it’s ridiculous! I

mean, they’re gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way,

one of them is gonna realize what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing

off. I’m telling ya, you’re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you’re

dancing at there’s.",58
Chandler," Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I

look like this… (Starts to dancing really, really, really badly. Ross enters behind

him and he stops.)",31
Ross," So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?",10
Ross, Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!,11
Ross," Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place

that her parents got married, but it’s going to be torn down, so… I mean, I-I

know it’s crazy, but everything up ‘til now has been so crazy, and I don’t

know, this just feels right. Y’know?",49
Joey," (still looking in date book) Hey! That’s the day after I stop

menstruating! (They all look at him.) This isn’t mine.",21
Rachel," Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. (Hugs him)

See you.",17
Rachel," I’m more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?",12
Rachel," ‘Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are

so on the right track! Y’know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are

clicking. Y’know?",34
Rachel," Yeah-yeah, y’know if-if there was just like one little area where

I—that I think we need—we would need to work on; I-I would think it was

we’re just not crazy enough!",31
Rachel," Well, yeah, right, y’know what? Yeah, you’re right, I mean, we

no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if (Grunts uncomprehensively)……I mean, I mean

like craaaazy! Y’know?  ",27
Rachel," (starts laughing) No-o-o. Yeah, you 

wish. (points at him). No. Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound

y’know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got

married?",38
Rachel," Oh, I know, I know, it’s-it’s so, it’s so totally like,

""Whoa! Can we do this?"" Y’know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right!

Don’t you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don’t you think?",40
Chandler," (waking Joey) Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!",11
Joey," (sleepily) Yeah, she is. Wow! (Falls back asleep, loudly) How you

doin’? You lookin' good. ",15
Chandler," You’re coming on to the entire room! (He goes over to pick up a

stack of magazines next to her, and to get her attention, he throws them back down.)

I’m Chandler.",32
Monica," (cocking her head from side to side in some pre-bouquet-catching ritual)

Yeah.",12
Monica," Look at me! My big concern is what’s real?! (Finally realizes) Oh

my God. We’re really sad, aren’t we?",19
Phoebe," Well, at least you didn’t rent yours from a store called,

""It’s Not Too Late.""",15
Phoebe," I hate my regular clothes now! Y’know? I look down and-and I

know that this isn’t gonna be the most special day of my life.",25
Monica," Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn’t you start

feeling silly?",16
Chandler," Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (They’re

stunned.) Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.",24
Joey, (muffled by the mouth guard) Hey you guys! What’s happening?,10
Joey," (muffled) Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it’s gonna

help me not to snore.",19
Monica," Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? ‘Cause I don’t think you

have to wear it unless you are!",19
Joey," (takes out the mouth guard) I know I don’t have too! It tastes good.

(Puts it back in.)",18
Rachel," Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl

who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.",26
Rachel," Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I

feel blue.",12
Monica," Ohh, sweetie! (Goes to comfort her.) Hey, I bet you anything that

he’s gonna call you again.",17
Rachel," Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think

he’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally

okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling

it all that well.",47
Rachel," Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on

again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on

again.",31
Monica," Hey! (She jumps up and throws Emily’s wedding dress into

Rachel’s room.)",12
Ross," So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about,

Ernie’s at 9 o’clock?",16
Ross," Oh, see I-I don’t know if we’re gonna be hungry at three.",12
Rachel," Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.",11
Rachel," It’s okay. Sometimes, things don’t work out the way you’d

thought they would.",13
Rachel," (breaking the hug) Oh, hey, don’t you have to go pick up Emily?",13
Rachel, Ugh. (She goes over and lays her head on Phoebe’s lap.),11
Phoebe," (looks at Monica) Hey, y’know what might cheer you up?",10
Rachel," Y’know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.",13
Monica," Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. (Pause)

Maybe someday, there will be.",21
Monica," Oh God! That's Chandler. He’s gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big

date!",16
Rachel," Okay, you guys, just relax. (She goes over to open the door, and as she

does, she says.) I doooo. (Sees that it’s Joshua, not Chandler that knocked on the

door.)",31
Rachel," Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! (Pause) (Comes back inside) Yeah, well, that

oughta do it.",14
Joey," (muffled by the mouth guard) Dude! I am trying to sleep! (Shrugs to

say, ""What’s up with that?"")",18
Chandler," Y’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has

happened.",13
Chandler," And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people 

would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! ",29
Joey," No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing

everyday! We could totally do that!",18
Chandler," Why not?! I mean it’s just, it’s just climbing! It’s

just, it’s just steep!",14
Chandler," We’re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass

print on Everest!",16
Phoebe," Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and

y’know you can die. And, you would die!",22
Chandler," Yeah, we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all!",12
Joey," And while we’re down at the video store, you know what else we could

rent? Die Hard! (Chandler’s excited.) Oh, y’know what? I just remembered,

that Everest thing is only available through mail order.",34
Phoebe, So you guys’ll stay here and hang out with me?,10
Chandler," But I’ll tell you something. One of these days we’re get off

of our butts and rent Die Hard again!",20
Ross," Wow! That was fast. It usually takes me 

two hours to get Ben to go down for his nap.",19
Ross," Oh yeah, that's because he has lots of 

mommies.  Yeah, in fact, it's kind of become his word for ""woman"". ",20
Ross," Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he’s so cheap, he’d never fly to

London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough? (Hands her

some envelopes.)",32
Ross," Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn’t invite her?",11
Rachel," Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]",13
Ross," Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as..

more of a general wondering... ment.",20
Ross," OK. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....",11
Rachel," Oh, look at the little cat! [a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross]

Look at it!",18
Rachel," All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to

take me with it! ",17
Ross," Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? [Ross turns and bangs his head on

an open dryer door.] I'm fine, I'm fine.",23
Ross," The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's

too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.",25
Ross," Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed

that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.",27
Rachel," Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends,

asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you

don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.",37
Rachel," Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and

you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.",29
Monica," Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can’t believe my brother’s getting

married! And in London! It’s so romantic!",18
Joey," (taking apart the invitation) Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You’re

at the wedding, you have to cry, ""Handkerchief?"" ""No-no, I got my

invitation.""",23
Phoebe," Oooh look! Isn’t this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!",10
Phoebe," Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross’s wedding?",10
Joey," Don’t worry man, I get to bring a guest. We’ll show him.",12
Phoebe," I’m so jealous you’re all going! I can’t believe I never

knew that you can’t fly in your third trimester!",20
Joey," I knew that! (They all look at him) I sooo didn’t know that, but you

should see your faces.",19
Rachel," Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don’t have to do that! I’m

happy for him! I am! I really—I’m-I’m happ—I’ll work on it.",25
Chandler," This isn’t one of those uh, y’know ""If she doesn’t

come, we-we don’t, we don’t come?"" Right? Because I already bought my

ticket…",23
Monica," You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren’t there. Just

say you’ll think about it, okay?",19
Rachel, Oh... [opens it]... [sees it is a pin] Oh my God. He remembered.,13
Rachel," It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw

this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I

was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!",45
Phoebe," Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.",11
Chandler," Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with

Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?",22
Rachel,"  (seeing Ross come off the plane with another

woman.) Oh my God.",12
Ross," But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess

who's in charge of the dig. ",20
Rachel," Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-

you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?",14
Ross," Oh, that is so sweet.(listens) No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two,

three.(He doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet.) Well you didn't hang up

either. ",32
Ross,"  Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-- (Rachel grabs

the phone and hangs it up for him.)",19
Rachel," [on phone] Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say

that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat...(cut)...I

am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. [hangs up and

tosses phone in the ice bucket]",49
Ross," Rach, I got a message from you.


[Rachel comes out of her room, suddenly she remembers leaving the message.]",19
Joey," He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.",12
Rachel," Yeah. It’s just gonna be too hard. Y’know? I mean, it’s

Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y’know it’s just, it’s for the best,

y’know it is, it’s… Y’know, plus, somebody’s got to stay here

with Phoebe! Y’know she’s gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to

help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labor.",68
Rachel," I know. (Starts to cry) Yeah, see, there’s so much to do and I have

so little time to do it in.",22
Chandler," All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that

there’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the

book.) ""It’s almost as good as being there.""",36
Joey, It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear!,11
Joey," I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our

hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!",24
Phoebe," (angrily) That’s like the tenth time I’ve peed since I’ve

been here!",12
Phoebe," Yeah, oh I’m sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya,

it’s a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da 

Funk on your bladder! I’m so tired of being pregnant! I 

can't sleep, except on my back which hurts! So I can't sleep! The only happiness I get is from a

cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, ‘cause—Oh! I’m pregnant!",71
Rachel," So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?",10
Ross," All right, here’s the ring. (Shows Chandler the wedding ring he plans

on giving Emily) ",15
Joey," Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning

bachelor parties, don’t you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?",24
Joey, What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!,10
Ross," Joey, I figured you’d understand. I mean, I-I’ve known him a lot

longer.",13
Joey," Come on Ross! Look, I-I don’t have any brothers; I’ll never get

to be a best man!",17
Chandler, You can be the best man when I get married.,10
Ross," (to Chandler) Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never

get to be yours at all?",21
Chandler," Oh no-no-no, you—yeah, of course you get to be my best man.",12
Joey," (impatiently tapping Chandler on the shoulder) What about me?! You-you

just said I could!",14
Chandler," I’m not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for

science fiction writers!",14
Ross," Fine, y’know what, that’s it. From now on, Joey, I want you to

be my best man.",17
Phoebe," It’s not kicking me, it’s kicking one of the other babies. Oh

(looks down her dress)! Don’t make me come in there!",22
Joey, Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?,11
Joey," Oh, we’re having a big party tomorrow night. Later! (Starts for the

door.)",13
Phoebe," Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!! (Joey walks back in, scared.)",12
Monica," What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you’re having a party

and we’re not invited?",17
Rachel," All right fine! You’re not invited to the party we’re gonna

have either.",13
Joey," Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don’t want to do!

Later! (Finally, he makes his exit.)",19
Phoebe," I can’t believe I’m gonna have a party! This is so great!

(Really excited) A party! (Really, really excited) Yay!! (Suddenly, she starts crying and

Rachel moves to comfort her.) I don’t know why.",34
Joey," This is what I’ve got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a

lot of liquor.",18
Joey," Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I’ve got you, me, and

Chandler and I’m gonna invite Gunther ‘cause, well, we’ve been talking

about this pretty loud.",29
Joey," All right—oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I’d really

like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.",24
Ross," Yeah. Tell ya what, let’s not invite any of the anthropologists, only

the dinosaur dudes!",15
Ross," Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.",10
Chandler," Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.",10
Ross," Yeah, see, I don’t think it’s gonna that difficult considering

this one won’t be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.",23
Chandler," Oh, I’m Ross. I’m Ross. I’m too good for the Hut;

I’m too good for the Hut.",17
Ross," Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just

remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing

poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?",37
Chandler," See ya. (Ross exits, and Chandler moves over next to Joey, laughing.)

Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.",19
Joey," Well, there’s gonna be strippers there. He didn’t say anything

about no strippers.",13
Monica," Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! (She shows Rachel

what she bought. She bought a little leather jacket and a little cowboy outfit for the

babies.) Can you believe they make these for little people?",41
Monica," Okay, look at this one. This is my favorite. (It’s a little pink

and white dress for the girl baby.)",20
Monica, I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!,10
Rachel," Huh. Except, Phoebe’s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.",13
Rachel, Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!,12
Monica," Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after 

she’s done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila,

a carton of cigarettes!",26
Rachel," Oh no, it's a great idea, it's a 

great.-- Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she’s always wanted!",20
Phoebe," What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it 

would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can’t use for another two 

months?! This sucks! Who gave me this?!",34
Phoebe," (sarcastically) Oh, oh. All right, then 

I'm wrong! It's a great gift! The best present I ever got! OH! All right, 

what’s my next present?!",25
Phoebe," All right, fine, then this is over. 

(gets up and kicks a present. Then heads to the bathroom where on the way she 

pulls down one of the ribbon strips laying across the room) God! (Then she 

starts hitting some balloons.) Balloons!! (Monica and Rachel are shocked to say 

the least.)",51
Joey," So you know who to ask to host your next 

bachelor party? Huh?",13
Ross," Joey, I'm kind of hoping this will be my 

last one. ",11
Chandler," (banging a spoon against his beer bottle) Okay, a little announcement,

a little announcement. I’ve decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!",25
Joey," Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don’t-don’t forget your shirt. (He gives

Gunther his shirt and Gunther leaves.)",14
Joey," Oh, little party favors, check it out! (It’s a shirt that reads,

""Ross Geller, Bachelor Bash 1998"")",17
Joey," Oh-oh! (Shows him what’s on the back, ""Best Man Joey Tribbiani,

with a huge picture of him.)",17
Chandler," (banging on the bottle again) Okay, okay, a little announcement, I

just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, (to the

stripper) so is the position of the bride.",38
Ross," Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chili on your neck. (Chandler checks and

runs into the bathroom.) Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great.

And hey! See you guys Monday morning. (They museum geeks wave at him.) Thanks Joey.",43
Ross," Oh, thanks! (Takes it and throws it back into the box and leaves.)",13
Joey," Okay, hey, museum geeks, party’s over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice

lady. There you go. Back to your parent’s basement. All right. (The museum geeks exit

and Joey unlocks his door and lets the chick and the duck out.) Come on boys, come on out!

Here you go. All right.",51
Joey," Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the

wall. (The duck complies.) Hardly move. (The duck complies.) Be white. (The duck

complies.)",28
Joey," Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin’ ya. And listen if any of my

friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday…",24
Joey," Hey, (realizes he doesn’t know her name.) stripper! (He notices 

that the ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees it’s empty and starts to 

panic. He runs out of his room and starts banging on Chandler’s door) The 

stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get 

up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!",61
Chandler," Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this—Ah-ha-ha!!

You lost the ring! You’re the worst best man ever!",23
Joey," Dude, this isn’t funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night,

everything’s cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper’s gone and the ring is

gone!",30
Rachel, Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebe’s way.),13
Phoebe," I-I wanted to apologize if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy

yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.",20
Phoebe," Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.

(She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)",32
Monica," Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That’s great. So how-how

are things going?",16
Phoebe," Good. Y’know—no-no, okay, it’s-it feels like

everything’s been about me lately, so what’s happening with you?",16
Rachel," Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to

Ross’s wedding.",14
Rachel," It just might be too hard, given the history and all that…",12
Phoebe," Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street

and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.",28
Phoebe," Well, let’s see, it’s not. Really, like that. Because, you see

that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y’know a bunch of

y’know high school crap that nobody really gives y’know…",35
Phoebe," Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)",10
Joey," Ugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do! I called the company

that sent and th-they don’t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they yelld at me, if this

isn’t an emergency, then what is?",36
Chandler," I'll tell ya, Joe. I really wanna help 

you out but I got plans to go see Titanic so I've to got call 9-1-1 to 

found out what time it starts! (Joey looks like he is going to yell at 

Chandler.)",41
Ross," I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And

the guys from work had a blast. Y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelor

party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so…",46
Joey," So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that’s nice!",12
Joey," I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for

myself, I might want to get one of those…",26
Ross," That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and

the clothes on her back were all she had with her.",24
Chandler," So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little

squeeze.)",13
Ross," Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride

who has worn it has had a long and happy life.",24
Chandler," I think I heard what he said.  I 

believe it was, oh yes, ""The stripper stole the ring."" ",18
Ross," My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?!

H-how?! How could this all happen?!",17
Chandler," Well, I think it all started when you said, ""Hey Joey, why

don’t you be my best man.""",18
Ross," (dialling the phone) All right-all right, fine! I-I’m gonna call the

cops!",12
Joey," Dude, I screwed up, you don’t have to turn me in!",11
Joey," Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they’re gonna look into

it right after they solved all the murders.",21
Joey," I did that too! They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number.

They said, ""If I bothered them again they’d call the police."" I said,

""If you talk to the police, you tell them I’m missing a ring!""",40
Ross," So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there’s

nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!",20
Chandler," Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her

come to my office?",19
Joey," Oh, that sounds like fun, but we’ve got a ring to find!!",12
Monica," Here’s your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take a

step back.)",15
Phoebe," (sips it) It’s so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh of

relief.) Oh, thanks.",15
Phoebe, (sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.),10
Phoebe," Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that

was definitely one.",19
Monica," Wait, you can’t have the baby here! I mean I haven’t

sterilized it since the guys moved out!",18
Rachel," Okay. It’s okay. We’re gonna be okay. Y’know what?

It’s okay. I’m gonna, I’m gonna, I’m gonna boil some water and just

rip up some sheets!",26
Phoebe," No. It’s all right; it’s probably false labor. They said

that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.",22
Rachel, Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!,13
Joey," All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.

And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won’t recognize you because, well, why would

she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. (to Ross) You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I’ll

be uh, Mr. Wong.",49
Chandler," (to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all

turn there backs on her.)",21
Ross," Where’s my ring? My dead grandmother’s wedding ring? Where is

it? Where is it?",14
Joey," There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!",16
Ross, We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!,12
Joey," I don’t get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn’t

take it, and I didn’t take it; and you (Chandler) didn’t take it, then who did?

(The duck quacks.) Shh! We’re trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realize it at the

same moment and stare at Joey, who doesn’t get it. After a short pause, with the duck

still quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)",75
Rachel, I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labor.,11
Phoebe," Okay, I guess. I mean… I don’t know, it’s just, I guess I

know it’s going to be over soon.",20
Rachel," Well, isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.",13
Phoebe," I know. It’s just y’know usually when you’re, when

you’re done with the pregnant thing, y’know, then you get to do the mom thing.

I’m gonna be y’know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.",36
Phoebe," Okay that’s even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself

into, it’s just that now that they’re in me it’s like, it’s like I

know them y’know, I mean-I mean, it’s just not gonna be easy when these little

babies have to go away.",47
Monica," Aww, sweetie, but it’s not like you’re not gonna have

anything. You’re gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that’s even

better.",23
Rachel," No, really. Really, Pheebs, you’re not gonna be the one worrying

about saving for college, or yelling at them when they’re bad, y’know, or

deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won’t calm down. Y’know?",37
Monica," I mean, you’re the one they’re gonna come to when they wanna

run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.",24
Rachel," And y’know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.",12
Joey," So! Things can go wrong! You don’t know! What if he doesn’t make

it?!",14
Joey," Yeah, but what if he doesn’t? He’s such a good duck.",11
Ross," Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it,

and then does a double-take realizing where it’s been.)",24
Joey," Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.",13
Joey," No, it’s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let

you down!",17
Joey," Yeah, it is! You wouldn’t have lost the ring, right? Y’know

what, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man.",26
Ross," Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you

guys. ",16
Ross," Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are

my… I mean, I’m lucky to have just one good… (They all start getting

emotional.)",30
Joey," (starting to cry) I gotta go check something over here. (He walks away so

that they can’t see him cry.)",20
Monica," (looks over to see Emily putting on her 

grandmother's wedding ring) Hey, how come you're getting Nana's ring?",18
Ross," Oh, mom gave it to me.  She said 

something about it being a wedding ring and that you may not need....one.  

(realizing) I really didn't need to tell you all that. ",31
Monica," Y'know? I don't really think it's fair. 

I mean, I've always loved that ring. ",14
Ross," Oh, Mon, I'm sorry. I'd let you have it 

but Emily's gotten really attached to it. (Gunther hands him his coffee.) 

Thanks.",22
Monica," Hey, Emily, umm, did you know that that 

ring spent two days in a duck's colon? (Emily looks grossly at the ring and then 

at Ross.) ",26
Monica," Guys, hurry up! The flight

leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There

could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to

London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs

back to her apartment.)",46
Monica," Passport, check! (As she puts

away each item, she says check.) Camera, check! Traveller's

cheques, check! ",16
Monica," Myself. Y'know for remembering

to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check!

(pause) My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.",29
Phoebe," Yeah, my mom used to put her

head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time.

But it was pretty weird.",25
Ross," Oh! Got 'em right here, (Pats his

coat pocket) check!",10
Joey," It's all London, baby! Here we go.

(He takes a picture of a less than enthused Chandler and starts

towards the girls' apartment.)",23
Joey," Yeah, in my third drawer on my

dresser. You don't want to lose that.",14
Monica," Okay, if you need the vacuum,

it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are

next to the refrigerator...",23
Phoebe," Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna

be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?",15
Ross," Well, we're all here! I guess we

should get going!",10
Phoebe," Ohhh, I wanna come over there

and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I

don't-can't get up.",23
Phoebe," Oh, and great! You might as well

bring me my book, it's on the counter in your apartment.",18
Chandler," Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebe's

book as Rachel comes in from her room.)",13
Ross," Thanks! (They hug.) Ugh, I can't

believe you're not gonna be there!",12
Ross," To London! Come to London. Please?

It'll mean so much to me.",12
Rachel," Because, I can't! Ross, I told

you, no. I can't.",10
Monica," All right, y'know what? We

really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!",14
Ross," Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on

video when we get back.",10
Chandler," (entering, with Phoebe's

book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.",14
Phoebe," Oh, do you need a hug? You don't

have to bring me anything!",13
Joey," Okay, here! (Gives him the

camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop,

Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his ""pop-up"" map of

London. All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)",38
Joey," It's London, baby! All right, the

hotel's here. (Points to the map.) Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I

know. (Sets the map down.) I'm gonna have to go into the map. (So

Joey literally steps into the map.)",39
Chandler," Okay, if you see a little

version of me in there? Kill it!",13
Joey," I got it! (Picks up the map and

starts walking.) Here we go.",13
Chandler," Okay. Listen-listen, we're not

gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?",15
Joey," Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me

lose it! (He goes into the map again.)",14
Ross," Sweetie, you gotta relax.

Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.",13
Monica," Yeah, y'know, but something like

salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And,

you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. (Ross pushes

her.) But of course with

salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting

married!",51
Ross," Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is

beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.",12
Monica," (entering) Okay, I talked to the

guy with the shovel and I found out what happened. ",16
Joey," All right! Westminster Abbey!

Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! (Pushes Chandler in

front of the camera.) Okay. What do you think of the Abbey,

Chandler?",28
Chandler," I think it's great. It's

great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this

place.",16
Joey," Man, you are Westminster Crabby.

(He starts chasing Chandler towards the Abbey.)",12
Monica," You're gonna

find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you

postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about

it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that

you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon....

Mmmmm... Salmon!!",53
Monica," But either

way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's

gonna like you better than me.",19
Rachel," Come on! I am here to take care

of you! What do you need? Anything.",15
Rachel," Oh, I don't know. I guess we

have to eat.",10
Rachel," I'm just bummed about the way I

left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having

to work. He seemed so mad at me.",27
Phoebe," Eh, don't be so hard on

yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting

married...",18
Rachel," Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's

wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really

uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean,

hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly

I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! I mean, I

still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have

continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm

still in love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him,

but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!",101
Phoebe," Yeah, we all know! We talk about

it all the time!",11
Phoebe," Well, because we thought you

knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica,

""Hey, you like things clean."" Or, y'know, ""Hey, Joey, you're

gay.""",27
Phoebe," Oh, please!

She's always got a broom in her hand!",10
Joey," Check this out? Huh? (Joey has

this big tall hat with a British flag on the front of it.) Yeah.

That's the stuff. What do you think?",27
Chandler," Well, I don't have to buy

that, ""I'm with stupid"" T-shirt anymore.",12
Joey," Well, I like it. Here you go. (He

pays for the hat.)",12
Chandler," All right, look, you're not

really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed

me enough for one day?",21
Chandler," How can I answer that when I'm

pretending I don't know you?",12
Chandler," Oh really? Then how come no

one here is wearing them?",11
Chandler," All right, look, if you insist

on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest

of the afternoon all by yourself.",23
Joey," Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If

you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the

hat.",21
Chandler," Okay, wait. All right, that's

it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed

anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand and

walks away trying to be cool.)",36
Ross," Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and

you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new

place for the wedding.",26
Ross," Postpone it? Emily, do you think

Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do

you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people

took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be

here, huh? (He puts his pants on backwards.) This isn't right.",50
Ross," I can't ask people to do that?

Would you ask people to do that? (Holds out his pants)",18
Ross," The only thing I understand is;

postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting

married.",18
Ross," No. I'm saying it's now. (He

starts putting on his pants, backwards again.)",13
Ross," There's no 'or' in mind. What is

wrong with these pants?!!",11
Ross," (chasing her, trying to zip up his

pants. His got them on right now.) No, wait! Emily! No, wait,

stop! Emily, please-(He catches something important in the zipper

and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)",39
Phoebe," So, did shopping make you feel

any better about Ross?",10
Phoebe," Well, I think I can help you get

over him.",10
Phoebe," Yeah. I just need you to bring

me some photos of Ross.",12
Phoebe," And a glass of tepid water. (She

gathers up all of these things.)",13
Rachel," Ooh, is this one of those things

where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it

from a north-facing tree?",25
Phoebe," Uh, only if you have the hiccups

too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate

is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna

show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember

all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his

flaws.",58
Rachel," I can do that. I certainly did

it when we were going out.",13
Phoebe," Okay. Umm, before we get

started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I

think he's such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel

grabs it out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And

imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're

kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his

body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh

gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?",82
Rachel," I don't know, his uh, his hair

never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more

crunchy than it was greasy.",24
Phoebe," Okay, this is going to be harder

than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.",17
Phoebe," All right, and umm... (She grabs

the picture and smacks her in the head.) ",14
Chandler," No-no-no, y'know what? I

really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean

that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better,

I've had a really lousy day.",33
Joey," Noo!! I've had the best day ever!

Dude, check this out! Now,

I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring.",24
Joey," Sh-shh-shh! (He motions for her to

watch something he has taped.)",11
Joey," (on tape) Okay, so say hi to my

friend and tell him that you like the hat. ",17
Joey," Well, I was trying to figure out

how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map

and-and...(Ross enters) Hey!",22
Ross," Hi. I understand you had a little

talk with Emily.",10
Ross," Am I?! And was it your idea to

postpone the wedding?!",11
Ross," Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it'

lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she

doesn't want to have the wedding at all?",26
Ross," I don't know, I told her it was

stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and

she liked flipped out.",25
Monica," Emily has probably been planning

it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a

pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we

did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place,

with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with

the little people on top. (Ross gets thrown a box of Kleenex from

the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the most

important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just

how important all that other stuff was.",95
Ross," I had no idea. And that-that

pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying

nun.",18
Ross," Come on. You gotta help me figure

out what to do. Okay?",12
Ross," Come on. (They leave and Chandler

sticks his head out.)",10
Joey," Yeah. (Pause) Hey, I hope Ross

didn't think that we just went in there because we were

uncomfortable being out here!",21
Phoebe," Ooh! I thought

of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!",11
Rachel," Oh, right!

(BEAT) Wait a minute, I do that too.",10
Phoebe," Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just

say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I

was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't

care if he looks like you.",39
Joey," That just cost me four bucks. But

uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are

doing?",22
Phoebe," Ohh, they're having a great time

with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all.

So, do you miss me?",22
Joey," Kinda, but I've just been having

way too much fun.",10
Phoebe," Yeah. But y'know we were

thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special.",14
Ross," Okay? But-but imagine a lot more

lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers,

and candles...",16
Monica," And the musicians, look, they

can go over here (Points to a little alcove), okay? And the

chairs can face this way (Points), and... (Points to Ross) You

go.",29
Ross," But-but, if you don't love this,

we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's

fine, whatever you want.",23
Phoebe," Yeah, it's in the guys'

apartment under the sink. Why?",10
Rachel," (enters with a bag packed)

Because I'm going to London.",10
Rachel," Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I

love him. Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies

until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.) ",27
Phoebe," But what about

all the ""finding-his-flaws"" stuff we've been doing?",10
Rachel," Yeah, I know, I know, I know he

does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all

the information and then he can make an informed decision.",33
Phoebe," That's not why you're going!

You're going because you hope he's gonna say, ""Yeah, I love

you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy.""",23
Phoebe," No! Because he's in love with

the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna

mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late!

You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really

hard, it's over.",44
Rachel," Y'know what? No. It's not over

until someone says, ""I do."" (Exits)",12
Phoebe," I do! I do! I do! (Chases her

into the hall, but Rachel doesn't stop.) I do! (Gives up.) Ugh,

like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.",30
Phoebe," (In a British accent) Hello. This is

Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much

trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham,

please?",29
Phoebe," No no no, I'll be nice, I

swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?",19
Phoebe," Ok, somebody is on their way to

ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if

you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there

and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.",43
Phoebe," Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew

I could kick her ass.",11
Joey," (Looking up at the waiter)That's

not food...No, I don't, no...(Taps Chandler on the shoulder.)

Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my

family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what

Phoebe looks like.",38
Chandler," Joey, it's been three days,

okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to

relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.",24
Joey," (Pointing at Chandler.) Your

different here too. Your mean in England. (Chandler throws his

hands up to his head in frustration. They walk away from each

other.)",27
Ross," (Holding him back.)Dad, dad,

please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight.

Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. (Picks

up the bill.) Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?",40
Monica," (Looking nauseous from her

parents kissing.) And I'm going to go get drunk. (Gets up to get

a drink.)",19
Rachel," (Faking cheerfulness.) Hello.

Umm, when is your next flight to London?",11
Rachel," How about 600

and these earrings? (Shows the ticket agent her earrings.)",12
Rachel," (looking through her wallet.)

Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card.",17
Rachel," Ohh, okay, how about five. (She

hands her all the credit cards.) Ohh, thank you.",15
Rachel," (Looking through her purse.)

Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly

where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I

have my drivers license and I have a twenty. (She slides it

across the counter.)",46
Ross," Look, face it, my father is not

going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can

kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new

lawn.",34
Ross," I go back there with lawn

ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.",14
Phoebe," (Looking relieved. She puts down

the phone.) Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I

know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk

about it, that's fine. I just want you to know, I think you are

doing the right thing and...",50
Rachel," (Running back out the door with

her passport.) Bye, Pheebs.",10
Phoebe," (Trying to get up.) Wait!! Where

are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! (Not able to get

up.) God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!",30
Chandler," I'd like to toast, Ross and

Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding,

so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will.

(No one in the room laughs. He starts to get flustered.) Okay. I

known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going

out with his first girlfriend. (Ross looks embarrassed.) And I

thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he

over inflated her. (He laughs. Jack looks at Judy and no one in

the room laughs.) Ohh, Dear God.. (A cellular phone rings.)",106
Phoebe," Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to

speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.",19
Phoebe," Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one

of Ross's best friends.",10
Phoebe," I got it from

your maid. She's a bitch, but I wore her down.",14
Phoebe," Yeah, um, I can't fly. I'm

having my brother's babies.",10
Phoebe," No..umm, could I talk to one of

them? It's very very important.",12
Phoebe," Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to

kick her ass too.",11
Chandler," (Continuing his toast.) And

I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting

married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting

married in Monty Hall. (No reaction from the people.) Ohh, come

on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All

right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily. (He sits

down.)",60
Joey," Hey, best man number two, Joey

Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here.

Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy

couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back

home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well

anyway, I love you guys. (pointing at everyone.) But not as much

as I love America. (Looking at Chandler.) Could we please..go

home now?",70
Joey," (Putting his arm around her.) I'm

not going anywhere, sweetheart.",10
Monica," Well I didn't want everyone to

think I was stupid.",10
Monica," My mother's driving me crazy,

but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. (A drunken man

approaches.) I'm not going to let anything spoil that.",24
Ross," Look, were down to just one point.

Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.",17
Chandler," The guy was hammered, okay?

There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.",13
Chandler," Because he's crazy. Okay? He

came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving

performance in Titanic.",20
Monica," Oh, my mother's right. I'm never

going to get married.",10
Monica," Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom,

with a thirty year old son!!",12
Rachel," Hello. I need to get on the 11

o'clock flight.",10
Rachel," Okay, you know what? 

You're going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing

around and come and pick me up.",24
Rachel," Sure, you know what? Come on,

we'll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the

""engine"".",20
Rachel," Look, If I don't get to London!!

He is going to marry that other girl!!!",15
Rachel," All right, you know what? I am

not leaving here, until you call that plane back!! (She pounds

her hand on the counter twice. The ticket agent counters by

placing the closed sign on the counter and tapping it twice.)",40
Chandler," (With the covers pulled up to

his chin.) Morning, Ross.",10
Monica," (Comes up for below the covers

and looks concerned.) Do you think he knew I was here? (Chandler

quickly looks at Monica not knowing what to say.)",27
Rachel," Ohhh.(she rhythmically taps her

hands on the magazine on her lap.)",11
Rachel," Oh. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

Sorry. (She hums and sighs happily.) It's just, I'm ahh, I'm

kinda excited. I'm, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy

that I love him and... (He puts his headphones on to ignore her.)",42
Chandler," So, ahh, how are ya? How

ya...How ya... You okay?",10
Chandler," Yes...Yes..Uh-huh,

You?(Looking over at her. She looks back.) We did you.",11
Monica," (Scoots towards the side of the

bed.) Could you not look?",11
Joey," Hey. I spent the night out. I met

this cute bridesmaid. She is so...",14
Joey," Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still

my number one girl.",10
Phoebe," No! No, we have an emergency.

Okay? Rachel's coming to London.",11
Phoebe," No it's not great. No, she's

coming to tell Ross that she loves him.",14
Phoebe," I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop

her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!",14
Joey," Hold on. Hold on. (Picking up a

note pad and writing and reading the message aloud.) Rachel

coming. Do...Something.",19
Phoebe," Okay, so I'm done my part, okay.

It's your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?",18
Rachel," ...And so then I realised. All

this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross

about why I couldn't come to the wedding. Was all just a way

of...",32
Rachel," Well, he doesn't

really love her. I mean, it's just a rebound thing from me....

You'll see!",17
Joey," Look we've got to find her. Phoebe

just called!! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him!!",17
Joey," I know! That's why we got to find

Monica!! You know where she is? ",14
Chandler," No!! Okay!! What's with the

third degree?! Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?!

(Joey looks totally confused.)",21
Monica," Well, I love it. I only hope my

wedding looks this good.",12
Monica," (Angrily.) You can let some of

them go by!(Judy and Andrea go to the front of the chapel. Joey

approaches Monica.)",21
Joey," (Whispering.) Pisst, Monica.

Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll

cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the

building and I got Chandler covering Ross.",35
Monica," (Awkwardly.) Why would I care

where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even

like Chandler.",18
Ross," (Using a slightly different

inflection for each.) I do. I do. I do.",13
Joey," (In a New York accent.)

Fuggetaboutit. (She giggles.) How you doin?",11
Ross," (Stepping in between them.)Okay!

Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this

is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I

hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! (Pointing at his mother.)

That's right!!",39
Ross," (Sighing.) It was...This

disagreement over...(She sighs. Ross notices her in her wedding

dress.) My god. You...you look beautiful.",18
Ross," You know what, I think we've had

all the bad luck we're going to have. (He hugs her.)",18
Ross," My God. Rachel! (He walks towards

her, grasps her hands and kisses her on the cheek.) Your here. I

can't believe it. (She giggles.) What happen? Why are you here?",30
Rachel," Well I just came...(She touches

him near his heart. She's almost in tears.) I just needed to tell

you...(Looking into his eyes. She takes a deep breath.)

Congratulations. (He hugs her. She can barely hold back the

tears.)",38
Phoebe," Yea. Can I please, please,

please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last

time I promise.",23
Joey," (Smiling.) Ohh great!! (Putting

the phone to his ear.) Hello. (He begins to escort her down the

aisle.)",18
Joey," No, but it's okay. She just came

in and gave him a hug, that it.",15
Phoebe," Oh that's so great! Ohh, so

what's going on now?",10
Joey," Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the

aisle...Still walking. (Mrs. Waltham takes her place.) I'm about

to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. (Looking at

the bridesmaid.) Hey! (Talking to Phoebe.) I told her

""Hey."" And now I'm at the front with Ross. It's Phoebe.

(He shows Ross the phone.) He looks pretty mad. Uh...I'd better

go.",58
Phoebe," No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh

please, hold it up so I can listen. (Joey looks at Ross and holds

the phone above Ross's shoulder.)",24
Chandler," Totally crazy stupid. (He nods

his head at the people seated.)",11
Ross," Take thee, Rachel...(All his

friends have looks of shock on their faces. He realises what he

said. Quickly he says.) Emily. (A slight chuckle.) Emily.",25
Rachel," (To the woman sitting in front

of her) He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up

there?",20
Ross," Take thee, Rachel...(All his friends have looks of shock on their faces.

He realizes what he said. Quickly he says.) Emily. (A slight chuckle.) Emily.",25
Rachel," (To the woman sitting in front of her) He-he said Rachel, right? Do you

think I should go up there?",20
Chandler," I've had a very long, hard day. You're 

home early.",10
Joey," Yeah, my date threw up. Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?",14
Chandler," For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!",10
Chandler," Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about

chicken.",15
Chandler," Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a

Coke-(Yelps in pain as Monica grabs him underwater)-Diet Coke.",22
Phoebe," I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this

driver…",16
Joey," Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.",10
Monica," Wait, what that place, that pub he took us to?",10
Phoebe," Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat—I don't want to talk about it.",14
Joey," Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad

boys.",14
Ross," Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.",14
Monica," Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, (Checks watch)

she should be here by now.",18
Ross," Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?",12
Monica," No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.",13
Ross," Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the

airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife!

Rachel is my wife! Y'know—Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?",44
Ross," HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! (Chandler is so shocked at Ross's

outburst that he drops his spoon and backs up) Oh! You-you think you can be beat

me? Let's go! Outside!! (calmly) I'm sorry, I'm just a 

little...",37
Ross," (to Monica) Oh you want some?! Okay, get the shoes on! 

(points to her room) Let's go man! ",18
Ross," Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.",10
Rachel," Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.",12
Ross," That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.",11
Rachel," Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met

the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel. (Goes and puts her luggage away.)",28
Ross," (breaking the hug) Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! (Runs to the

door.) Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem,

red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That

oughta get her talking to me again.",56
Chandler," Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.",15
Monica," Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!",14
Rachel," What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I

couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up

to me all the time going, ""Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?"" I mean, it was

sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why,

because I make very bad decisions.",73
Rachel," Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.",15
Rachel," I put on a cheerleading outfit to seduce 

Joshua.  Then I lost him because I asked him to marry me after four dates. 

And then I went to Greece on somebody else's honeymoon. Okay? Do those sound 

like very good decisions to you?",43
Monica," I like you're little braid. (Both her 

and Chandler motion at it.)",12
Rachel," All right. You know what? I just 

shouldn't be allowed to make decisions anymore. Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now

on you make all of my decisions for me.",36
Phoebe," Oh… No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having

that kind of power and control over someone's life.",22
Rachel," That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.",13
Chandler," Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned.) Always

a pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)",26
Monica," Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you

at the reception.",16
Rachel," Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't—I still can't believe

it. (Rachel grabs the picture from Monica)",18
Rachel," I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it (She grabs the rest of

the pictures)…",17
Rachel, Oh my God! (She licks the top picture and hands them back.),12
Monica," Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I

know that wasn't about me.",19
Joey, (To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little.,10
Monica," If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice

that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns to

listen in.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute.",35
Monica," (Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points at

another guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at

the counter that time.",30
Monica," You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your

decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.",25
Rachel," All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.",14
Joey, Say that to him and you're golden. (She just glares at him.),12
Monica," We got out pictures back from London. (Shows her one.) Here's all of us

at the Tower of London.",19
Phoebe," (Grabs the pictures) Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and

Joey and you and me. (She picks up a magic marker and draws herself in. Monica can't

watch.)",30
Chandler," All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much

haven't we?",13
Phoebe," No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever

get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.",26
Monica," You know what I like to do? It's sounds 

a little corny but sometimes when I'm bummed out, I like to just close my eyes 

and think about what a wonderful gift life is. ",34
Rachel," Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date

tomorrow night.",16
Monica," See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!",10
Chandler," I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.",10
Chandler," So, thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over, grabs her, and kisses

her.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs her

and kisses her.)",33
Joey, (Jumping out of his way) See ya!! (To the girls.) What the hell was that?!,15
Monica," Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.",11
Joey," (intrigued) Well I guess it's time for me 

to say goodbye too, mon frere. (looks at Monica) Come here and give me a 

little sugar.  (Monica puts her hand in his face and pushes him away. He 

leaves.) ",38
Rachel," Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this.

Umm, okay, just hold on a second.",21
Ross," It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for

each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!",26
Ross," Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go

wander out in the rain for a while.",22
Rachel," Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right

here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All

right? (She goes out to talk to Dave) Hey, Dave!",39
Rachel," Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just

really sick. Okay? Bye! (She goes back in to talk to Ross.) Honey, listen, I know, I know

things seem so bad right now.",38
Monica," (Poking her head in) Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped

some socks.",17
Rachel," Yeah. (She goes out to join her in the hall and starts looking for the

dropped socks.)",17
Monica," What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you

want to fall into the trap?!",22
Monica," I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you

listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What

the hell were you trying to do?",43
Rachel," Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted…tell him y'know,

that I'm still in love with him.",17
Rachel," Why? Why not?! People love to hear that! 

Come on I love you. Now, wasn't that nice?",17
Rachel," Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what,

you're fired.",15
Monica," You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say,

""I'm not fired!"" Ha!",15
Rachel," Well… (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica's laundry and

throws it on the floor as a diversion to allow Rachel to run back inside and close the

door. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)",43
Joey, I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.,12
Rachel," Ross, there's something I wanna talk to 

you about.  I just need to..",13
Monica," (still pounding outside) Rachel, I can 

do this all night if I have to! ",14
Rachel," No. Y'know what?  Just let her do 

her thing and we'll do our thing. Because I really need to tell you...(Monica 

pounds continuously.)",23
Monica," Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?",12
Monica," Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted

to do?",15
Monica," Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a

really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows

who she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting.",39
Ross," Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I

gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. (Looks at the rose mulch.) My

God, think of the massacre.",35
Monica," All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you

tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea.

Because I bet you, you can't.",37
Monica," So did you find anyone that agrees with 

you, yet? ",10
Rachel," No. But you know what? I think-I think I 

need a male point of view. (Chandler leans in.) Joey. (Chandler leans back.)  

You're a man.",25
Rachel," Do you think it would be a good idea if 

I told Ross that I was still in love with him?",21
Joey," Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to

go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?",26
Joey," All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all

take a little trip together!",20
Phoebe," Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!",11
Monica," Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (Phoebe gasps), in Central

Park!",15
Phoebe," That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we

gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? ""Well, it's right by my house, all

right!"" ",32
Chandler," Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park

idea. (Gets up to leave.)",19
Rachel," (stopping him) Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr.

Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European

thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable

and I just—y'know—stop it!",46
Chandler, I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.,12
Chandler," Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little… Y'know, it

didn't have any… It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we

would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!",38
Phoebe," Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?",12
Monica," Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?",11
Phoebe," Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!",13
Ross," Well, I think I'm gonna grab some coffee 

because my ass is already packed. (They all think about it and grimace at the 

thought.) ",24
Rachel," Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.",11
Monica," No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.",11
Monica," Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone

that you love them and not have them say it back?",25
Monica, Okay. I-I can't watch. (Leaves as Ross sits down to read the paper.),13
Rachel," Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to

talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're

wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.",39
Ross," Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized…",10
Rachel," Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.",10
Rachel," Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say

it. Uhh, (pause) I'm still in love with you Ross.",23
Ross, Wow. Umm… Huh… I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.,13
Rachel," Because (laughs), because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's

ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and

it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know?

And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel (laughs) was like,

""You are such an idiot!""",64
Ross," Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife

since the wedding.",16
Ross," Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where

my wife is. (Laughs) ""Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?"" Don't know! ",25
Rachel," Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you

just forget that I told you this?",22
Ross," Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is…",11
Rachel," Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that

just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?",21
Ross," No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always

great when someone tells you they love you.",21
Rachel, That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice. (They hug.),12
Rachel,"  Oh, God. I'm just glad I didn't 

give you the cassette I made of all of our songs. ",18
Rachel," Come on, you remember! In the living 

room? On Monica's laundry? ",11
Rachel," Well, it was really hard but..umm..I'm 

glad I did it. ",10
Monica," Yes. I need it for my score book.  

(Rachel is shocked as Monica tries to retrieve what she just said.) Diary.

",21
Phoebe," Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for

rolling bones! ",13
Phoebe," All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun! (She starts out the door.)",13
Chandler, Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!,10
Phoebe," Okay. Well, there's probably one on the 

way to Atlantic City. ",11
Phoebe," Wait, wait, remember when my water broke? (They all high-five again.)",11
Chandler," Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel

every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.",30
Monica, (In a sexy voice) Come in. I've been waiting for you. ,11
Rachel," Hi! I just wanna-(sees Monica)-Ahhh!!! Oh my God! (She runs out in

horror.) Oh my God!",16
Monica," (pulling on a robe) Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was

taking a nap.",17
Rachel," Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me

you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!",28
Monica," Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. (Thinks) I'm seeing a guy from work!

Ha!",16
Rachel," (Gasps) That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks

like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?",17
Rachel," Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm

just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. (There's a knock on

the door.) Maybe that's him. (Goes to answer the door.)",43
Monica," (Panicking) Okay, umm, okay, umm… (Rachel opens the door.) It's

just Joey and Ross.",14
Joey," Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us

out!",16
Ross, I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!,10
Joey," Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping

that someone will help him get in touch with her.",24
Ross," (on phone) I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy,

old twit!",16
Chandler," (entering, happily, with a bottle of champagne, thinking that Monica

is the only one there) Ha-ha-ha-(sees everyone)-enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all

here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!",33
Ross," Oh hi, is this Nanny Hopkins? I'm-I'm 

looking for Emily. (listens) Waltham. (listens) Oh, I-I'm sorry. Is this 

0-1-1-4-4-7-4-2-9-3-4-7-4-2-6-7? (listens) Oh it's ""4-3"", not 4-2. Oh, we-well, 

which 4-2?  ",29
Monica," Vomit tux? Who vomited on—y'know what, what you up to Joe?",11
Joey," Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as

co-host!",17
Joey," A little uh, good deed for PBS plus a little TV exposure, now that's the

kind of math Joey likes to do!",22
Phoebe," Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this

really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I

wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one

ever wrote back.",50
Chandler, Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.,10
Phoebe," All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box.

I didn't have keys!",22
Joey," I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed.

Like-like you did with the babies.",20
Phoebe," This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally

selfish.",16
Joey," Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother?

Talk about selfish!",15
Joey," Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel

really good right?",18
Joey," It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no

unselfish good deeds, sorry.",17
Phoebe, Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.,11
Joey," Are you calling you people? (Chandler rolls his eyes.) Yeah, well sorry to

burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on

Santa Clause right?",32
Phoebe," I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil

genius.",14
Ross," Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! (He picks up a lamp and

hands it to Chandler, for no reason.) It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! (to Emily)

Hi!",30
Ross," No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling!

I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk

to me!",34
Ross," Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really

miss you.",14
Phoebe," Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?",12
Chandler," Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",11
Rachel," So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?",12
Monica," Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone

yet.",13
Chandler," Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",10
Rachel," I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever

had!",15
Chandler, Really?! That's what you heard? (To Monica) You said that?,10
Monica, I might've said that. (Chandler laughs.) Why is that funny?,10
Chandler," Because I'm very happy for him! (To Monica) And you, you lucky

dog!",13
Monica, But you live here! (Ross rolls his eyes.) You know that.,11
Chandler," Well, you can just video-conference 

with him.  (Ross gives him a look.) I'm not ready to have children. ",18
Ross," I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London

with Ben.",19
Monica," Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another

country so you can patch things up with your new wife.",25
Ross," Yeah, but-but it'd be great. They-they 

have great theater, great accents. Uhh, umm. (tries to think of something else) 

Tea.  They have a queen. ",24
Ross," Hey! Guess what?! We're moving to London! 

(looks at Carol)  Yay! ",11
Ross," Oh, umm, (in a British accent) Welcome to 

London, governor. Right, right. It'll be great because we'll have Big Ben and 

little Ben in the same city.  Ooo-ooh! (to Ben) Hey, go pack! (puts him 

down. Ben runs to his room.) See? See, he wants to go. ",47
Ross," Come on, come on. It'll be just like 

Three's Company only-only there's a kid and my wife and-and you're the gay 

ones.  (Susan and Carol walk away.)",27
Joey, (To the pledge volunteers) How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!,12
Joey," That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.",12
Joey," You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.",11
Phoebe," I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy

that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his

front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful.

That old jackass!",51
Phoebe," I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three

children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!",30
Chandler," (entering) Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?",10
Chandler," If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret

boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?",20
Monica," Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret

boyfriend.",14
Chandler," Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had

learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this. (He

jumps up onto the table and starts doing his happy dance.)",43
Ross," All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London

without Ben.",18
Ross," Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna

move here anyway, why can't you just do that?",21
Ross," Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete

idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so

we can work this out.",35
Ross," Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna

be like-like-like two idiots in love!",21
Ross," Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.",12
Ross," So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.",15
Ross, No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.,10
Ross," I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed

to make this kind of a decision? (They're all quiet.) I'm actually asking you!",31
Chandler," Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best

friends.",14
Monica," Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.",13
Phoebe," Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut

her out of your life.",18
Monica," Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?",15
Joey," See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV

and that's good exposure. ",21
Joey," Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? (He waves his hand in front of the woman

next to him and you can now see his arm on TV.)",28
Joey, Hello New York! (The woman bats his hand out of the way.),12
Chandler," How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the

cooking channel!",14
Monica," Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.",13
Chandler," Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up

caterpillars. ",16
Chandler," Expect it in 4-6 weeks. (She starts to leave.) Umm, hey, umm, Joey's

gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.",31
Chandler," Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best

you'd ever had.",16
Monica," Why? (She hops into the living room and imitates Chandler's happy

dance.)",12
Monica," With all the stupid gloating, would you 

want to sleep with you? ",12
Chandler," Well, I think I'd be a little out of 

my league, but I'd give it a shot. ",17
Phoebe," (on phone from Central Perk) Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know

that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.",35
Phoebe," Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee

is happy and I am definitely not.",22
Joey," Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.",10
Phoebe," (Thinks for a moment.) Aw, dammit! (Slams the phone down.)",10
Monica," Yes, it really does cost that much. 

Maybe next time your duck can puke in something from Pottery Barn. ",19
Ross," (entering) Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too

difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. (He holds up and

starts shaking a…)",32
Monica," A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision

with a toy!",16
Ross," Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose

one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before

I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got

nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. (There are none.) Okay then.

Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? (He turns it over and reads the

answer) Ask again later. Later is not good enough. (He shakes it up again and reads the

answer.) Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!",113
Monica," All right, let me see. (She grabs the 8 ball.) Will Chandler have sex

tonight? (Reads the answer.) Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.",28
Ross," Okay, one more time. (Shakes it.) Should I 

never see Rachel again? ",12
Rachel," Hey. Ooh, Magic 8 Ball! What did you 

ask? (pause ensues) ",11
Ross," Uhh, (tries to think of something) 

does...Rachel get to pick the movie that we're all going to see tonight? ",19
Rachel," (excited) Excellent. What's the answer?  

(Ross turns it and Rachel reads it.) Woo-hoo! (puts her hands in the air) Looks 

like Stella's gonna get her groove back tonight! (Everybody else is less 

ecstatic.)  Wh-what? I heard it was good. ",39
Phoebe, I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.,13
Joey," $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to

ya?",14
Phoebe," Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to

lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good

thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.",44
Joey, And you don't a little good about donating the money?,10
Phoebe," No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.",11
Phoebe," Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV!

Oh that makes me feel—Oh no! (Realizes that her deed made her happy and therefore

it's selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)",37
Chandler," (entering) Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's

something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.",26
Chandler," I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which

wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH…MY…GOD.",26
Chandler," Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me

again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!",28
Monica," Well, if we owe it? (She throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps into

his arms.) Oh my… When is Joey gonna be home?",24
Chandler," Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. (She starts to

take off her latex gloves.) Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.",25
Rachel, For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.,12
Ross," Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check?

I'm waiting for a call from Emily.",22
Rachel," Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!",14
Ross," It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.",11
Rachel," Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.",13
Ross," No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your

help.",16
Rachel," Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you

need somebody to talk to… Hi!",21
Rachel," Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give

it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she

wants fixed. Just do it. (The phone starts ringing.) I mean, you're gonna have to

try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. (The phone keeps ringing.) Oh come on

answer it! It's driving me crazy!",67
Ross," (answering the phone.) Hello. (Listens) Hi sweetie. (Listens.) Good. Look

umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it.

(Rachel gives him a thumbs up.) So will you come to New York? (Rachel wants to know what

she said, and he gives her a thumbs up and she goes over and hugs him. All the time not

knowing what's going on.)",71
Monica," Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9

looks like.",15
Joey," I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise. (He goes into the

bathroom.)",15
Chandler," I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?

Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.",28
Chandler," Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a

chef thing.",18
Monica," Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in

Jersey!",15
Chandler," Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go. (He starts for his bedroom.)",12
Monica," (entering from her room) Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm

going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.",20
Phoebe," Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!",11
Monica," Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference

could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.",15
Chandler," I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people

to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.",24
Ross," I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.",16
Phoebe," Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see

Rachel anymore?",15
Ross," Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the ""I get to see my

wife,"" part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this. (He takes a big swig

of Pepto Bismol.)",35
Monica," Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together?

How is that even gonna work?",20
Ross, I have no idea. I mean… But-but I assure you I will figure it out.,15
Joey," So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.",13
Rachel, (going through the mail) Oh look! A letter from my mom.,11
Joey," (holding a box) Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke

up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at

the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.",48
Phoebe," Ooh, Madlibs, mine! (Grabs it.) 

(opens the book) Okay, ""Name of some one in room.""",15
Phoebe,"  Come on, seriously. (Chandler is 

less than enthused with the comment.) ",11
Joey," You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to

repopulate the Earth.",17
Ross," Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to

Emily…",15
Ross," Le Poo's still alive?! (Rachel shoves the 

note in Ross' face.) Ohh! Sorry. ",13
Rachel," Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for

nine-(turns over the note)-teen blocks. Oh. (They all come out from Monica's bedroom) Oh

my God.",31
Phoebe," I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.",11
Chandler, (jumping on the bed) I can't believe it! We're here!,10
Chandler," Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere. 

(They come closer together.)  This is so great. No 

one's gonna come in and bother us. And we're gonna do it. (yells) I'm gonna do 

it with Monica! ",36
Monica," Chandler. (yells) Chandler! Stop yelling 

that you and I are gonna do it! (They kiss.) Okay, be right back. ",19
Chandler," Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!",12
Chandler," (looks at what she's holding and shies away) Oh dear God, they gave us

glasses!",15
Monica," No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't

change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.  ",24
Chandler," You wanna switch rooms because they 

didn't change the glasses? ",10
Monica," Well, oh, I didn't wanna say anything 

but the carpet smells too. Come on

sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?",31
Chandler," Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's

feed! (He grabs their bags and sprints out.)",21
Phoebe," La-la-la (whistles) La-la-la 

(whistles again as someone leaves). La-la (whistles) (Phoebe starts to 

get the hint.) Forget it! (gets up)",20
Ross,"  (to Rachel) Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?",16
Ross," Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's

this one thing… Okay, (Rachel has her back turned to the camera, and Ross isn't

looking at her.) here goes. I made a promise that-(they cut to the other camera and Ross

notices something coming out of Rachel's nose)-Oh hey!",53
Rachel," Oh God. (He hands her some tissues.) No! Oh not again! (Wiping her

nose.) This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. (She puts her head

back.) Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?",42
Rachel," Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.

(gets up) Y'know what? I'm just gonna go shove a bunch of 

tissues in my nose.  Oh hey, do you wanna tell me while I do that?  

(small pause)",39
Chandler," Okay, great. (He grabs the remote and turns on the TV to the chase.)",14
Chandler, Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!,13
Monica," This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.",14
Monica," (To Chandler) Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a

second?",16
Monica," Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna

let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!",24
Chandler," I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you

just pick one so I can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.",28
Chandler," (watching TV, in fact, ER is on.) Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is

regularly scheduled programming! I wanted to see them talk 

to his neighbors. ",25
Monica," Well, I'm standing right here, you could 

talk to me.",10
Monica," Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire

weekend like this?",18
Chandler," Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?",15
Chandler," Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage

to 10 different rooms?",19
Monica," I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany

to Canada on a half a tank of gas!",23
Monica," We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it,

what is the matter with you?",17
Chandler," I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez,

relax mom.",16
Monica," You know what Chandler? You like 

getaways? Watch this. (She storms out.) ",12
Ross," Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now

and I really, I just have to get it out.",23
Ross,"  Okay, before I tell you I just have 

to know....is your nose okay? ",13
Rachel," Well, uh, let's see. Davey's still 

pining after LaPooh, but you know, he's a tough little turtle. ",17
Ross," Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my

marriage?",16
Rachel," Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.",10
Ross," And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she

wants… ",13
Rachel," That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? (Pause)

(Realizes) Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?",25
Ross," It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want

my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But

the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.",50
Rachel," Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's

the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!",23
Ross, You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.,14
Rachel," Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a

little bit easier for you.",21
Chandler," It was terrible. I fought with (Pause) my colleagues y'know, the

entire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another Rollo)",22
Chandler," Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.",12
Joey," You know, at the Taj Mahal, he has his own 

private glass elevator. That's right. Made by Otis Elevators. And they usually 

don't do glass. ",25
Monica," Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?",12
Monica," Oh, it was awful. (To Chandler) I guess some people just don't

appreciate really good food.",16
Chandler," Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then

made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.",21
Monica," Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my

half.",17
Joey, (sticking his head out the door) What are you guys woofing about?,12
Chandler,"  I was only stealing it back, the 

one that she stole from me. ",13
Joey," Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself

without twenties and you always have lots!",19
Ross," You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I

don't know what to do.",21
Joey," Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.",15
Rachel," Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but

y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about

it. All right?",34
Joey," I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right

back there. (Points over his shoulder.)",20
Phoebe, Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.,11
Rachel," Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.",10
Chandler," Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.",12
Rachel," See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up

they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay

his friend and what happened? He got phased out!",41
Rachel," Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your 

brother. (To Chandler) He's your old college roommate.",21
Phoebe," Kip didn't even have to be Kip. We 

handled that all wrong. It was a long time ago.",18
Joey," Yeah Rach. And it was before you and me 

were around. They didn't know what they were doing. Chandler had a mustache for 

crying out loud.",26
Rachel," Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave 

the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.",26
Rachel," Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right

out.",14
Joey," Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an

eyelash curler in your room.",19
Joey, 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.,14
Joey," Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look,

I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. (Pause.) Were

you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!",40
Rachel," Phoebe? (She turns her head further away.) I'm sorry about the whole

lifting out thing. (Moves over next to her.) You gotta come with me!",25
Rachel," Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're

the best ones.",17
Ross," (entering) Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?",13
Phoebe," Oh, sure! (She gets up to leave.) Bye Ross! (Whispering behind his

back.) Forever.",14
Rachel, Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?,11
Ross," I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the

one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.",29
Ross," No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their

sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey

at Burger King. So is, is that better?",36
Rachel," No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.",11
Ross," Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you

do?",14
Rachel," Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!",12
Joey," (entering) (He clears his throat to get their attention.) Hey, Rach? Sorry

to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.",28
Chandler," I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda

sucked, huh?",13
Chandler," Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.",10
Monica," Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with

someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh! (They both realize something

there.)",27
Monica," (laughs) You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and

move on! It's nothing to freak out about.",24
Monica," Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! (She goes to kiss him.)",11
Phoebe," Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.",12
Monica," Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.",13
Chandler," Joey, can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to drag

Joey into Monica's room.)",20
Chandler," The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a

big deal out of it.",19
Joey, But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! ,11
Monica," We know. Please? Please?! 

We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?

Just promise you won't tell.",19
Joey," All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but…",11
Phoebe," We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to

take Joey!",16
Phoebe," The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if

you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, ""Hi, Phoebe!""",27
Monica," Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.",13
Monica," Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means

something!",14
Monica," Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! (They all leave and

close the door on Monica.) Ohhh! (Throws her notepad down in disgust.)",25
Joey," (entering) Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living

under my roof!",15
Joey," Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like

looking at it.",15
Chandler, Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?,11
Joey," Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! (Starts for his

room.) And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I

have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's

nothing to know about.",52
Phoebe," Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my

grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have

heirlooms for crying out loud.",36
Chandler," Well, the only heirloom I ever got was 

a feather boa. Got it from my dad. He got it from his dad. How did I ever get 

born?",28
Phoebe," Eeeee-(She opens the box and removes its contents and sees that it's a

fur coat.)-ohh!! God! (She throws it at Joey.)",21
Phoebe," Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but

at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!",30
Chandler," Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers

bloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. Chandler sees her reaction.)

That didn't happen, I made that up!",32
Ross," Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.",11
Monica, (looking at the flyer) This is all of your things.,10
Ross," Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's—Emily thinks we should get all

new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.",24
Ross," Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York,

I'm sure everything will be fine.",21
Chandler," Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?",10
Phoebe," Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said

someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.",26
Joey," (after Ross is gone) What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's

furniture has got Rachel coodies?",17
Joey," No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see

Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!",24
Monica," Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's

happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you

cool with that?",32
Joey," No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.

Probably be some of the hardest acting I've ever done. 

Maybe I'll play it with a mustache. (Chandler makes a frustrated gesture.)

",31
Rachel," Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please

hurry up honey! Please? ",17
Monica," Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait

until I find the little waffle iron.",20
Monica," All right. (Looking through a box.) Op, here it is! Right underneath the

can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is

underneath the can of poison?",35
Phoebe, I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.,10
Joey," Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! (He drapes it around his shoulders.) Enh? All right,

what do you think?",15
Ross," (on the phone) No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. (Listens) No, it's great.

Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. (Hangs up.)",27
Ross," Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and

it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!",24
Ross," Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh

new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on

one side and Columbia on the other.",39
Joey," That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! (Phoebe pinches him.)

Which is great! I love to ride that rail!",20
Ross," Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get

so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!",27
Chandler," Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space.

We should get them together and make a continuum.",22
Joey," Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? (Phoebe pinches him

again.) Ow!! He's not even here!!!",19
Monica," We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy

man!",16
Rachel," It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a

bigfoot or a yeti or something!",20
Monica," And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!",18
Rachel," (proud of herself) Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his

yeti ass!",16
Joey," Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this

four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella. ",20
Monica," Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we

fog!",15
Rachel," Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged

you.",14
Rachel," Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought

you were like a yeti or something.",20
Rachel," Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your

acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.",26
Rachel, Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.,15
Phoebe," So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium? ",11
Phoebe," He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know,

bring in the next person I know who dies.",24
Rachel," Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!",10
Rachel," What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big

kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a

crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!",40
Phoebe," This is fashion?! (Grabs the coat from Rachel.) Okay, so to you, death

is fashion?! That's really funny. (She puts the coat on and starts to model it.) Here's

Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps

of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? (Sees herself in the

mirror.) 'Cause I do.",62
Ross," (on phone) I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you.

Bye. (Hangs up.)",20
Ross," I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps

right over there. (Points.)",16
Joey," Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing (The shutters that close off

the kitchen.) and it kinda knocked me out a little?",24
Ross," I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.",16
Joey," Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?",11
Ross," Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice…",11
Joey," You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are

you, are you crazy?!",17
Joey," It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally-(The gang enters

behind Joey and Phoebe pinches him again.)-Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys

said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told

me that he's not entirely happy.",54
Monica," No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're

having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.",24
Chandler," Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.",11
Ross," Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys

gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right,

it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all

laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real

life, okay? It's what grown-ups do! (He storms out.)",71
Phoebe, I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.,14
Chandler," Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've

happened.",14
Joey," Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound

to slip out! (He glares at Chandler.)",20
Phoebe," All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. (She puts on

her fur coat.)",18
Chandler," Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal

rights thing?",15
Phoebe," Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are 

not very nice. ",14
Phoebe," (a little hesitant) Well they real are 

bad. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I—it's the best thing I've 

ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! (She starts to leave but 

stops and says to Monica.) Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!",46
Rachel," Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know

if you hadn't looked so…. Y'know.",20
Rachel, What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!,11
Rachel," So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't!

Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!",24
Rachel," Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.",10
Rachel," Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgment. But you did it too! And you

are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgment! You can't even open up

your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?",48
Joey," Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff

and I just acted like a jerk.",21
Phoebe," (To Chandler) You're kinda stepping on the song. (She gets ready to play

but is stopped by…)",17
Joey," Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.",11
Phoebe," Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!",11
Ross," Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.",12
Monica, Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.,12
Phoebe," Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a

seeing-eye dog coat!",15
Joey," Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.",14
Joey," Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions

right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. (Makes

like he's juggling.) Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander

around, you're alone…",51
Chandler," Yetis are smooth talkers. That's why 

you never see any pictures of them.  (imitates one seductively) ""Come here 

baby. Give me the camera.""",23
Rachel," Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.",12
Rachel," Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you

with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really… I don't mind.",31
Ross," Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh… It would

really mean a lot to me if you stayed.",21
Joey," All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor…",12
Monica," Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll

all be hanging out together.",20
Monica," I'll get it. (On phone.) Hello. (Listens.) Hi Emily! (Listens.) Yeah, uh

you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. (She hands the phone to Ross.)",26
Ross," Hey! (Listens.) Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. (Listens.) Uh, yeah,

sure uh hold on. (To the gang.) She wants to say hi. (To Emily) Hold on.",26
Joey," Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure

who's not here and that's Rachel!!",22
Ross," (going onto the patio) Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends,

okay?",14
Ross," Emily that's ridiculous. (Ross hears 

someone dialing on the same line). Hello? Hello? ",13
Joey," Huh oh. Sorry dude. I had to make a call.

",10
Ross," Joey. Jo-(taps on the window with the 

phone. Joey gestures for him to hold on.) Joey they don't have two lines, they 

have two phones. ",25
Ross," (to Emily) I'm sorry. Emily, listen. I 

have never cheated on you. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends

out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll

see you're the only person I want to be with.",49
Ross," Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never

gonna work if you don't trust me.",22
Monica, How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!,13
Joey," You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. (He stands up and turns his

back to them so that he is facing the window.) Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. (The camera

cuts to Ross outside hanging up the phone.) Smile! (Ross turns around and sees Joey

alternately smiling and frowning and just stares at him for a second and heads back

inside.)",61
Ross, Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.,11
Phoebe," (to the squirrel) Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're

mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be

coats! (The squirrel stares at her.) All right, fine, now I get it. (To the clerk.) Here.

(She hands him her coat.) You take it. (To the squirrel.) Are you happy now? I'm cold!",60
Joey," I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.",11
Ross," Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then

you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.",24
Chandler, How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?,10
Joey," Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!",11
Chandler," Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise

me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!",28
Ross," Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get

packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.",28
Monica," Okay, knock yourself out, Larry. I don't 

get violations. You could just eat beans off that floor. But don't because 

that'd be a violation.",24
Phoebe, Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.,10
Monica," Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know

that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.",28
Phoebe," Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. (To Larry) Wow! You saw

the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it.

You can have your own health inspector detective show!",41
Phoebe," Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places

to eat.",15
Monica," He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're

not gonna try…",17
Rachel," Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff

again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I

don't go for guys right after they get divorced.",39
Monica," Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.",12
Monica, (To Monica) Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?,11
Rachel," I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out.

I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.",28
Rachel, Hi Danny! (Notices his box of liquor he's carrying.) Wow! Thirsty huh?,12
Rachel," (laughs) Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out,

because he wants me to ask him out.",22
Rachel," That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's

all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint

around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?",42
Rachel," No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up

for grabs. You follow me?",19
Monica," I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes

you.",15
Ross," Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really

appreciate you guys letting me stay here.",22
Joey," Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while,

why don't—I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.",27
Ross," Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check

this out. (He plays the greeting, and We Will Rock You starts to play and Ross's

voice comes over it.) We will, we will, call you back!",43
Chandler," (notices something) Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier!

All I heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)",24
Joey," Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't

you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!",29
Monica," Can't believe that Larry closed down 

Churman's. I love that place. ",11
Phoebe," Yeah, I know. But you should have heard 

about all their violations. Larry said that they should, umm, call it Vermin's. 

(laughs) That guy just plain kills me.",28
Rachel, Okay. (Closes the door.) Walked right into that one didn't he?,11
Monica, What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!,15
Rachel," Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would

know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I

said, ""No!"" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.",44
Phoebe," Oh, Larry just told me something about 

Sun Ling. (Thinks about it.) Oh, no, thank you. (Monica looks like she is going 

to regurgitate her food.)",26
Chandler, Okay. (Starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.),11
Joey," No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the

boxes. Come on!",19
Joey," All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?

(Imitates Ross's 'quiet down' maneuver, but does move his hands up and down he just flaps

his hands as if he's waving good-bye.)",35
Joey," Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you

know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that

had been porn?",35
Chandler," (gasps) All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is

Ross! I survived college with him!",19
Joey," All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.",15
Ross," (entering) Uh fellas, (Does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbs

up, which Chandler returns as he closes the door.)",21
Joey," You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken

and it was closed!",19
Phoebe," Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it

down!",17
Joey," Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where

are we gonna eat?!",17
Rachel, Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.,12
Monica," (to Danny) We'll be right there! (To Rachel) Can't you just say it

starts later?",15
Rachel, What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!,10
Phoebe," Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, ""See you

ladle."" (Laughs.)",15
Chandler," Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports?

International? Apartment listings?",13
Joey, Oh that's mine too! (Grabs it and Ross looks at him.) I'm Italian!,13
Ross," Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though

there's never anything in here.",17
Ross," (looks) Oh yeah! You're—hey, you're right! Here's an affordable

place, (reading ad) two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!",23
Ross," Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.",11
Joey," Hey, let's go look at it! (They both jump up.)",10
Ross," Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in

on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.",32
Ross," Oh my God! (Looking around, which doesn't take him long.)",10
Chandler," Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great!

Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.",20
Joey," Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.",14
Ross," I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.",13
Chandler," Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.",14
Ross," (To Joey) So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?",13
Ross," All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and

fill out an application.",19
Joey," He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! (Pause.) You think we

could get a bathtub in our kitchen?",23
Phoebe," Ooh, I love that place! (Thinks about it.) So, no.",10
Phoebe," Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That—this milk is mine. I

bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. (She takes a swig of it, but has

to turn away from him as she makes a face to show that it has gone bad.) Okay, let's go!",50
Phoebe," Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the

health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like,

okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?",37
Phoebe," Thank you. (To Gunther, who's standing there frozen) Okay, go! Go! Go!

(He runs off.) (To Larry) Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I

know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.",38
Joey," Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!",14
Chandler," Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the

window in a bag!",19
Joey," Hello! (Listens.) Oh yeah! (To Chandler) It's the apartment manager; Ross

put us down as references. (To the apartment manager.) Ross is the greatest guy you'll

ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.",32
Chandler," (grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh,

barks into the night. (Listens.) Well, who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah, he's a tap

dancer! (Listens.) Yes, some would say that is a lost art. (Thinks.) He's a pimp!

(Listens.) There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! (Pause.) Hello? ",59
Rachel," (puts her arm around Monica) Monica, 

honey, this is as real as it gets. ",14
Rachel," Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!",10
Rachel," No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from

the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.",29
Monica," (turns his back to the stairs) Oh, it's a great party! Great food.

Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. (As she's saying this

Rachel tries to head downstairs but is blocked by people coming upstairs. She quickly

retreats back up the stairs.) (Sees that she has to keep him distracted longer.) So umm,

what's this? (Points to his plate.)",64
Monica," Ooooh! (Rachel now succeeds in getting downstairs.) And-and-and

what-what's this? (Points again.)",12
Rachel," Yeah, sure. (To Monica) All right, whose court is the ball in now?",13
Rachel," Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere,

balls flying all over the place!",21
Rachel," No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going

on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!",28
Rachel," Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, ""Nice

try.""",13
Rachel," Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right

out of the park!",18
Joey," (getting up) Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! (He tries to take a step and

falls flat on his face.)",20
Ross," Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my

application.",14
Ross," Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her

place for a while. So…",20
Ross," Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.",11
Joey," Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there (Points

to where the window is but sees that there isn't any space there and points towards his

door.) by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!",36
Ross," So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain

in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay?

And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just (Does the

'quiet down' maneuver).",57
Chandler," Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the

cowboy hat is a little much?",19
Ross," (popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's fun!",12
Chandler," All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a

bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?",20
Rachel," Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving

dinner ever! I think you killed us.",14
Rachel," Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should

play that game where everyone says one thing that they're

thankful for.",22
Joey," Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall

we've been having.",12
Joey," I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a

feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do

with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is

it there? Is it not there?",43
Ross," Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more

thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.",18
Phoebe," Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to

come up with anything.",14
Ross," I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse

Thanksgiving ever.",11
Chandler," No-no-no! I am the king of bad

Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad

marriage and take that away from me.",24
Rachel," Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about

how your parents got divorced again are you?",17
Joey," Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be

Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!",16
Chandler," It's a tradition, like the parade. If the

parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire

family.",20
Rachel," Every time you

tell that story that guy's accent gets thicker and thicker.",13
Chandler," No no no.

After they got their own place, the houseboy got his own

houseboy..you should of heard his accent.",20
Ross," You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of

bad Thanksgivings.",12
Phoebe," I don't know about that. I've got one that's

worse.",10
Phoebe," Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with

the butler? Yes, mine's worse!",15
Joey," Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like

that! I don't have any past life memories.",17
Phoebe," Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey

got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!",18
Joey," Look. (He walks out of the bathroom with his head

stuck in a huge turkey.)",15
Phoebe," (walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did

it get on?",12
Joey," Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really

bad in here.",14
Phoebe," Well, of course it smells really bad. You have

your head up a dead animal's ass!",16
Monica," Hey, did you get the turkey basted—Oh my

God! Oh my God! (She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is

that?",23
Monica," What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be

funny?",10
Phoebe," No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's

supposed to be scary.",12
Monica," Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to

feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it

off your head!",24
Monica," Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull.

I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. (Joey starts

giggling.) Joey? Now is not the time!",28
Chandler," Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to taunt him,

but Chandler is in the doorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)",19
Joey," (pointing) It worked! I scared ya, I knew it!

Ha-ha!",10
Joey," (turning all the way around, and still not facing

Chandler) Yeah, you are! (Starts dancing.) I scared you!",18
Joey," Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an

idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say,

""Butternut squash?"" And it came out, ""Squatternut

buash?""",27
Phoebe," Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking

about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?",21
Chandler," Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and

getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for

me anyway. And of course, the Indians.",25
Monica," Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to

tell this story!",14
Monica," I'll get it! (She runs in, and she's her old

fat self like The One With The Prom Video. Not only that, she's

out of breath after running a short distance. She goes over and

opens the door to reveal Rachel with her old nose.) Happy

Thanksgiving!",47
Ross," Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and

lead singer of our band!",13
Ross," Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and

doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.",12
Chandler," Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it,

I'm in.",11
Ross," So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around

here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.",19
Ross," Well, that's cool. So did… (She walks away

from him and he shuts up.)",14
Chandler," So that's

Rachel, uh? The one girl you've been writing all those songs

about? You might want to re-think the lyrics of She Feels

Weird Since I've Been Gone.",29
Ross," Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl

that you and Jack were looking for.",16
Chandler," Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.",10
Ross," So I’m thinking about asking Rachel out

tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.",18
Chandler," Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don’t take to

long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight,

right Clifford Alverez.",23
Ross," Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I’m

gonna be out with her all night.",15
Ross," All right, it's cool you can stay here. My

parents won't mind.",12
Chandler," No, it's not that, I just don't want to be

stuck here all night with your fat sister.",18
Joey," Maybe it'd jog

your memory if you guys play a little bit of Emotional

Knapsack.",15
Chandler," I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot

back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out

loud!",25
Chandler," I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am

so, so sorry.",13
Rachel," Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I

was talking about.",10
Monica," (interrupting her) Okay, now Thanksgiving's

over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a

Christmas tree?!",19
Phoebe," Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got

broke in half, but y'know whatever.",15
Rachel," Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any

parking by the Psychology building.",14
Chandler," Yeah, we were just talking about that. I

can't believe how stupid we used to look. (They both quickly push

their sleeves over their elbows.)",25
Monica," What-what's the matter? Is there, is there

something on my dress? (She turns around making sure he gets a

good look.)",21
Chandler," You just, you look so different! Terrific!

That dress! That body!",11
Ross," Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's

really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse

team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both

teams!",34
Rachel," (entering) Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome!

You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just

drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!",29
Monica," Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel

great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah,

blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I

just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked

and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!",59
Rachel," Well guys tend to get naked before they're

gonna have sex.",11
Monica," What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard

and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to

someone like him!",24
Rachel," Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it

that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not

actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him

think that you are.",37
Monica," And when he's naked I can throw him out in the

front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just

humiliate him!",25
Monica," Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have

sex with him?",14
Rachel," Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like

everything around you turns you on.",15
Rachel," Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm,

oh-oh, like this dishtowel! (She grabs it and starts rubbing it

on her cheek.) Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek!

And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or

I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers

while I talk to him.",65
Rachel," Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming.

He's coming. (To Chandler) Hey, what's up? (She leaves and closes

the door behind her.)",22
Chandler," Monica, I was wondering if you can make me

some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.",19
Monica," Umm, I'd love too! (She goes over and picks up

the box and decides to follow Rachel's advice and holds the box

up to her cheek.) Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love

the way this box feels against my cheek.",43
Monica," Boy, I love carrots! Oh! (She picks up a bunch

of them and holds them between her fingers.) Sometimes I like to

put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here

while I talk to you. (She is rubbing her hip with the carrots.)

Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick

up this knife (She picks up a knife without putting the box down.

She's holding the box between her cheek and shoulder) and-and

umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, (Pause) my body. (She

doesn't have any exposed skin within reach of the knife, so while

holding the carrots in one hand and the box between her face and

shoulder, she rubs the knife on her stomach.)",128
Monica," Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just

that—(She drops the box and in a reflex action tries to

catch it with her arm, the knife slips out and slowly flips

through the air and comes point first down into Chandler's shoe.)",42
Ross," Can you please not do that feet first? You know

where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!",20
Monica," Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice! (She

takes a bag of ice out of her purse and hands it to the doctor.)",25
Monica," Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give

me the keys to your Porsche!",15
Chandler," That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called

you fat?!",11
Monica," I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an

accident.",11
Chandler," That's why for an entire year people called

me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!",11
Chandler," Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best

part. It has the nail. (He storms out.)",17
Chandler," Yeah, well, sorry doesn’t bring back the

little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this

stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.",28
Monica," Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything

I can do? Anything?",12
Chandler," Yeah, just leave me alone for a while. (He

goes into his apartment.)",13
Chandler," Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, ""Quack,

quack!"" I’m happy all the time!",13
Monica," Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on

the turkey.)",11
Monica," Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of

sunglasses on the bird.)",12
Monica," I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and

Chandler cracks up.)",12
Chandler," Nothing! I said, I said ""You're so

great"" and then I just, I just stopped talking!",16
Chandler," No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop

it!",11
Chandler," Top of the world? Dock of the bay? (He tries to think of another but

can't) I'm out.",18
Joey," I don't know uhh… (Pause as he thinks about it.) Well, I'm Joey.

Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.",25
Rachel," Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?",10
Rachel," (waving them in his face) Take 'em! (Joey makes a noise and jumps out of

the way.) Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.",25
Joey," That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop!

(Realizes he still has the underwear in his hand.) Ahh! (Throws them towards Chandler's

room.) And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?",35
Joey," Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep

embarrassing me! (To Monica) Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I

didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a

play. And one thing led to another and (He puts his leg on the chair and pulls up his

pants leg to reveal that he now has shaved legs.)",77
Monica," (inspecting his leg) Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough

spot.",14
Chandler, (interrupting him) All this lying has been hard on us too.,11
Joey," Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!",10
Joey," Meanwhile, I get Rachel shoving your 

underwear in my face and asking when she can come see me star in Ugly Woman!

",22
Monica," We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want

everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really

well is because it's a secret.",35
Chandler," I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.",13
Joey," All right! But, (To Monica) you do it with me once.",11
Rachel," But I don't get it. Does anybody else 

just take off their underwear when they're hot? ",16
Phoebe," Umm, Withering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New

School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.",23
Chandler, I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.,12
Phoebe," Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this

time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less

painful final exam.",31
Phoebe," Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to

sit with!",16
Phoebe," Yeah! Okay—ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?",12
Phoebe," This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.",13
Rachel," Uh, but what time does the class start? 

(Phoebe shushes her.) ",11
Ross, My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!,10
Ross," Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice

and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone

ate the only good thing going on in my life!",43
Monica," Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was

going to eat it myself, but (motions that he can have it.)",26
Ross," (quietly) That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still

can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything. ",25
Chandler," (reading) Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's

lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?",19
Phoebe," Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I

learned that living on the street.",20
Ross," Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, ""Keep your

mitts off my grub?""",16
Chandler," Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she

surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?",19
Phoebe," Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. (Writes him a note and

the gang reads it.)",18
Phoebe," Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.",11
Phoebe, I thought you said you read it in high school.,10
Rachel," Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep

rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway—umm, what is this book about?",32
Phoebe," Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and

umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think

represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.",37
Rachel," Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.",14
Rachel," Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I

think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.",21
Phoebe, Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!,10
Phoebe," I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.",11
Phoebe, Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!,13
Rachel," Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was

really embarrassing what happened to you!",20
Ross," Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but

people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller,

yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.",38
Monica," Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.",12
Ross," That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for

me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with

people you can get anything you want. (Joey walks by with a cup of coffee.) Hey Tribbiani,

give me that coffee! Now!",50
Rachel," Joey, is what she just said umm—Oh my God. (Looks around the room.)

You were actually gonna… (Chandler picks this moment to return to the living room.)

(Rachel stares in shock.)",31
Rachel," And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?",14
Joey," I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films. (Points

at Chandler, angrily.)",15
Joey," You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good

Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!",22
Joey," Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the

underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!",26
Chandler," No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them

you had to make an adult film for your (Thinks) adult film class.",26
Joey," Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my

underwear at your place?",18
Joey," Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!",10
Monica," Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just

give us a little more time.",18
Joey," All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. (Starts

for his room.) Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!",24
Ross," Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all

because of a sandwich.",18
Ross," Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her

secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the

Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here… ",42
Ross," (getting upset) Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey

sandwich with a Moist Maker?",17
Ross, Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?,10
Ross, You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!,10
Ross, MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.),10
Rachel," Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.",10
Rachel," Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.",10
Phoebe," Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a

woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg. ",21
Phoebe," Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.",10
Phoebe," Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very

interesting insights.",15
Rachel," Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane

Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.",25
Monica," Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I

thought that I would give you just a little preview. (Hands him a Polaroid.)",28
Chandler," Which I may say, right now, is out of control.",10
Ross," Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of

absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a

tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.",45
Monica," Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?",10
Ross," I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I,

I definitely don't care about my sandwich.",24
Chandler," Yeah, y'know, I hate it when they make 

me see the shrink at my office. You know, he's always like ""Oh maybe your 

colleagues will like you better if you like yourself better."" Who needs that?",36
Rachel," (entering, angrily) Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you

let me go on and on like that!",19
Phoebe," (smiling) I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane

Eyre to Robocop. ",16
Phoebe," Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.",10
Rachel," Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be

something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!",27
Phoebe," Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know,

people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high

school.",31
Rachel," Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just

wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?",25
Monica, (yelling and waving her hand in the air) I know! I know! I know!,14
Rachel," You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!",10
Ross," (entering, with the rest of the gang) What's going on?",10
Chandler, (Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.),12
Rachel," Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us!

And then he eats chicken and looks at them!",23
Ross," (covering his eyes) Dude! That's my sister! (She shows the rest of the

gang.)",14
Phoebe," All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give

our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!",25
Joey," No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just… I just…

Kinda…",12
Chandler," All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.",10
Joey," What?!! (He turns around and stares at Chandler who's silently pleading

with Joey to go along with it.) No I'm not!!",21
Monica, Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!,12
Joey," No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!",15
Joey," Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.",13
Ross, This is not good for my rage. (Takes another pill.),10
Joey," Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's

been going on?",17
Rachel," Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your

underwear in our apartment the other day?",21
Joey," Ahh—oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London.

Right Monica?",14
Monica, I guess I wanted to keep it (Pause) as a souvenir. ,11
Chandler, Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?,13
Joey," No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been

trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!",25
Phoebe, So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.,11
Monica, I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.,13
Monica," I know. I know. I know. I will, and I 

would appreciate if we all could just, you know, drop it immediately, and 

forever. ",24
Ross," Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you

do that?!",14
Monica, I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.,11
Joey," Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's

not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so

the chicken's up for grabs. (Offers it to everyone.)",40
Phoebe," I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got

cut off.",16
Monica," (entering, happily) All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just

convinced Paul to give us a test next week!",19
Monica," Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! (Running out) We

should have essay questions!!",17
Joey," (high pitched female voice) I can see you 

Mr. Bing.  You look sexy in your new suit. ",17
Phoebe," That's weird. You're starting to sound a 

lot like Chandler lately. ",11
Ross," Well I guess if you're going back to work 

I'll probably just hang out . You know, make some calls. ",20
Phoebe, Is that a new suede jacket? It looks really expensive.,10
Monica, Yeah. I guess. (She puts more money in the bucket.),10
Monica," Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay? (She pours out the rest of her

change purse into the bucket.)",21
Phoebe," Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy. (She waves her arm and

spreads her joy.)",15
Phoebe," But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.",12
Phoebe," Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just… (She

scowls at him.)",15
Joey, That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!,13
Ross," I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something

happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what

about those Good Will Hunting guys?",34
Joey," Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the

chances I could get those guys to star in it?",24
Joey," I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor. 

I could-I could act like a writer. Here. (gets a notepad and pencil. He then 

pretends he is a writer who just got an idea and writes it down) But see? (shows 

Ross the notepad) Nada.  I don't have the discipline

that takes, y'know? I can't do it.",57
Ross," I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to

it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.",24
Ross," (grabbing a notepad and sitting down) All right, we'll start off slow. The

only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.",30
Rachel," I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm

around her.",18
Rachel," Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our

relationship!!",14
Rachel," No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the

plan!",15
Monica," Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl?

Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with

Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway

girl.",50
Rachel," She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the

date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.",26
Joey, Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.,12
Joey, Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!,12
Joey," Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.",13
Joey," Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have

to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.",27
Chandler," Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets

home.",15
Joey," (jumping up) All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a

notch?",17
Joey," All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid. ",10
Chandler," Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit

back.",13
Joey," Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.",13
Chandler, Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?,12
Joey," Uh yeah, right here. (He punches his fist through the wall next to the

door.)",15
Phoebe," Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't… (The lady ignores her and

walks off.) Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!",22
Phoebe," Hey!! (The bucket starts smoking.) The charity's on fire! Help! (Yet

another guy walks by carrying a cup, which Phoebe grabs.) Oh good! Thank you, I need that.

(She throws onto the smoldering fire. Suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) Whoa! What is

that?! (She sniffs the cup.) (To the guy.) It's nine o'clock in the morning!",57
Ross," All right. (Reading.) A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. (Stops

reading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.) That's it? (Joey shrugs.) Joey,

you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident!

(Flipping through the rest of the pad.) And what is, and what is all this?! (Reading.) The

official rulebook of Fireball.",63
Chandler," (entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven

mitts) Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter

fluid—Op! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)",41
Ross," This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not

the creator of crazy lawsuit game!",21
Ross," (To Chandler) And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to

work. (To Joey) Now come on! ",19
Ross," No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done!

(After Joey walks past, Ross throws the ball down in pain.) Ahh! (Chandler shows him the

burn spots on his oven mitts.)",35
Rachel, So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.,10
Rachel," You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? (Danny nods,

""Yes."") Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on

the couch!",27
Rachel," (not sure what to do) Uh, it was very nice meeting you. (They continue

to ignore her.)",17
Phoebe," Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put

in here! Look! (Hands it to Monica.) Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?",28
Ross," So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?",11
Phoebe," Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice

Bucket!",15
Monica," Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.",12
Phoebe," Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know

what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you

guys. Sorry. (Leaves.)",31
Rachel," Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys

wrestle?",16
Rachel," Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl

on the subway.",16
Rachel," Yeah, they were very y'know…wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?",10
Monica," You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna

go?",15
Monica," Ready? (They grab a hold of each other's necks.) Wrestle! (They start

wrestling.)",13
Rachel," Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.

(She leaves them to wrestle.)",17
Chandler," (entering from his bedroom) Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in

20 minutes! Come on, Joe!",18
Chandler," (To Ross) Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he

relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.",23
Ross," I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.",11
Joey," Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never

played.",11
Chandler," The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored.

Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.",20
Ross," And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if

you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.",25
Chandler," Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?",12
Ross, If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.,10
Joey," Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of

Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!",21
Ross," How about we settle this right now! (He rips up the tickets.) There! Now,

no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!",21
Ross," No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!",11
Joey," Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.",10
Joey," Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really

pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!",27
Chandler," Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.",11
Chandler," So I guess you're gonna have to cancel 

your date.",10
Phoebe," Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look.

(The lady opens up her hand.) Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. (She throws the

lint away.) What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! (The lady walks away.)",44
Phoebe," Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and

then you can make a contribution! (The guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on his

face.) And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (Her boss and a co-worker

walk up.) Hi Bob! (The same old lady from before walks bye.) (To the old lady.) I thought

I told you to get outta here!",72
Phoebe," Fine. (She hands her bell to Ginger and starts to take down her signs.)

(The same old lady walks by again.) All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for

that bitch. (The old lady.)",36
Rachel," Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond,

and…",14
Rachel," Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on

here but let's…",16
Rachel," No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.",14
Rachel," Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it

does sort of…",17
Rachel," Yeah, okay, I'll see you later. (Gets up and runs from the apartment.)",13
Chandler," Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down

there and give them a project, ruin their day?",22
Ross," Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach

them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.",24
Joey," (entering) Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already

finished my five pages for today!",19
Chandler," Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! (Pause) Last night!",12
Ross," I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to

focus. Huh?",16
Chandler," Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL

THE LIVE LONG DAY!!",17
Joey," Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it.

And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So

would you guys read it for me?",40
Joey," Okay. (Reading.) ""It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys

are hanging out."" Ross (Points to him.)",18
Ross," Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest…

(Pauses and looks at Joey.) But we had our best friend's interest at heart.",27
Ross," I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. (Stops reading.) All right

Joey, we get it. (To Chandler) I'm sorry.",19
Joey," Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.",12
Joey," A handsome man enters. (Playing the part of the handsome man.) Hey! How's

it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to

both of you. You, (Ross) you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you (Chandler) well

you co-created Fireball. The end.",54
Joey," No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up

with new, Ultimate Fireball. (Takes out a bowling ball and a propane torch.) Ha-ha!",29
Joey," (Reading the scene set up.) Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment.

Two girls are just hanging out.",19
Rachel," I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!",10
Monica," It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really

appreciate it?",15
Joey," Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal,

so Monica and Chandler are doing it.",24
Rachel," No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! (She sits next to him on the

couch.) Fine I want—I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?",29
Ross," (disinterested) Hey-yeah. (He hurries up to the counter.) Hey Gunther, can I have

a scone please? (To the gang.) Wanna hear some good news? ",24
Chandler," Is somebody else gonna give it to us? 

Because you certainly don't seem like you have any ",17
Ross," No-no-no I do. Someone I know is 

getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my 

ex-wife Emily!",21
Ross," Oh, thanks Gunther. (He takes it, hands the plate it's on to Rachel, sets it down

on the table, and proceeds to pound it into oblivion while saying.) STUPID BRITISH SNACK

FOOD!!!!!!!",32
Chandler, Did they teach you that in your anger management class?,10
Phoebe," Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and

Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the

Louisiana Purchase?",39
Monica," Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we

celebrating?",18
Chandler," Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.",13
Monica," I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a

real couple. We don't have to hide.",25
Chandler," I know, I can do this. (He takes her hand.)",10
Monica," Ooh, and I can do this. (She kisses him on the cheek.)",12
Chandler," I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, (Points to Monica) this is

Monica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.",27
Chandler," Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one

too.",16
Chandler," And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you

repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis

with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when

we bumped into each other at that strip club. (She glares at him.) Strip church. Anyway,

I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.",72
Chandler," Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park

and hit rocks at…bigger rocks. (He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.) Hey

Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?",39
Rachel," Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.",15
Monica, What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.,14
Rachel," Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my

friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with

you?",36
Rachel," Oh y'know what, we don’t have to talk about work. We can talk about

anything!",15
Monica," Well, I-I—there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but

I don't anymore.",18
Rachel," Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, (checks watch) y'know what though Mon, I actually do

have a lot of work to do so if-if—are you sure there's just not anything else?",30
Monica," Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?",14
Rachel, No! (Gets up to leave.) (Under her breath.) If there was I wouldn't tell you.,15
Phoebe, (gasps) Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (The chick clucks.) You'll get your turn!,11
Phoebe," Nothing! (Picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.) (To the chick.) This

is not over!",18
Ross," I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and

now it's all covered in-in… (The duck quacks.) Actually, thanks!",26
Joey, (entering from his room) All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?,13
Ross," Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.",15
Joey," Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and

stuff.",18
Ross, (licks the envelope and encounters a foreign substance on the glue.) Oh God!,13
Monica," Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be

carved!",17
Chandler," Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.",13
Monica," Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's

popping pills.",19
Chandler," Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro?

(Does his work laugh.) (To Monica) Please let them win!",26
Monica, I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.,13
Monica," I got it! (She hits a forehand smash that bounces right in between Doug and

Kara and scores a point.)",20
Chandler," Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashed

racquet from his bag.)",17
Chandler," If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow

night.",15
Monica," Y'know what really bothers me? Is—it's how-how different you act around

them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the ""I'll see you

around, Bing!"" ""Not if I see you first, Doug!"" (Mocks the fake laugh.)  ",40
Monica," I know you don't but Work Chandler does. I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.",22
Chandler," Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.",12
Monica," I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.",13
Joey," That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.",13
Monica," Oh my God! (She goes to hug him, stops short, and hits him on the shoulder.)

Where the hell have you been?!!",22
Rachel," Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!",14
Ross," I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.",17
Rachel, You walked around all night in the city by yourself?,10
Joey, (snaps his fingers) He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.,11
Ross," Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do

whatever I want!",19
Phoebe," Oh, nobody's judging you. (They all turn and look at Ross.)",11
Joey," So I guess you finished your book. (smiles 

at him) Had some time on our hands did we? ",18
Ross," Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say…",11
Joey," All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He

obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.",24
Monica," But it's Janice! I mean, 

she's......Janice! How drunk were you? ",10
Ross," Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common!

We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.",17
Rachel," (entering) Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during

our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even

when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!",51
Rachel," I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, ""I'll just

tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours."" And he said,

""Laundry? Is that my new nickname?"" And you said, ""No! You know what

your nickname is, Mr. Big.""",47
Monica," Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me

know how that one turns out.",20
Rachel," Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.",16
Monica," Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr.

Big…(Thinks)…ot.",15
Rachel," All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on 

between you and Chandler?",16
Joey," All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?",16
Joey," All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removes

the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) And

they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)",44
Ross," Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with

Janice! ",18
Ross," Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to

me. I mean I talked for hours. (Joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.) It

is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.",43
Phoebe," You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We…",10
Phoebe," (turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an

old Wonton!",14
Monica, (To Chandler) How does that laugh not give you a headache?,11
Monica," Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be

it for me on the work things.",23
Chandler," So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?",11
Monica," I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out

with my boyfriend who I actually respect.",23
Chandler, Oh. (Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.),12
Monica," (interrupting) Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.",11
Monica," Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see

Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was

weak physically. You get it now honey?",37
Chandler," I think I do! (They all laugh.) Thank you, Monica.",10
Joey," (entering) Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?",14
Joey," Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.",14
Rachel," What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps

lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right

now! (Exits.)",34
Chandler," (from his bedroom) All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist

jokes now?!",17
Monica," Sorry! I'm just—I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate

having to lie to Rachel!",20
Monica," I know! It's just that…ever since high school Rachel was the one person I

told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.",28
Monica," Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the

fact that she's wearing men's boxers.]",21
Rachel," Well, I was actually—I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm,

look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.",23
Monica," Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was

cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!",25
Rachel, Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.,11
Monica," Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.",18
Rachel," That's good enough. Right? (Pause.) Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my

books!",15
Rachel," 'Kay. (Pause.) Congratulations on your new job. (She goes and hugs Monica and

is almost in tears.)",17
Ross," Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on

sabbatical from work, right?",23
Ross," This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my

marriage falls apart and then…",20
Ross," Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm

too whiney? (Janice makes an agreeing sound.) So you're saying, I've become so whiney that

I annoy you, Janice.",34
Ross," I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I

hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. (He laughs, his real

laugh this time.) What you're-you're not mad?",41
Ross," Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't

uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or

girls they're related to.",32
Chandler," (realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him) I am mad! But you

know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They

forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well,

but I want you to remember that I forgave you.",56
Chandler, I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!,14
Chandler," And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) seven

dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it

down—let's write it down!",35
Monica," I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So

good for Monica! ",15
Monica," Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best

massages!",14
Chandler, It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it! ,12
Monica," Oh hey, now stop trying to add more time 

to your massage. (Puts the timer behind her and continues to massage him) Say good-bye to sore muscles!",27
Chandler," I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like

she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just—I didn't know

what it was!",33
Joey," Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.",12
Chandler," Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay,

I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.",25
Joey," Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! (He picks a hat up from

the floor. It's one of those magician stovepipe hats.)",24
Chandler," (examining the hat) And the bunny got away. (Turns and starts looking

for the bunny as Joey puts the hat on.)",21
Ross, (glaring at Joey) This would be the place where you explain the hat.,13
Joey," Oh. Okay. This is called a top hat. (Makes 

a face like he couldn't believe Ross asked that question.)",19
Ross," And why are you wearing this...? Is it 

""top hat""? ",10
Joey," Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of

this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that

everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion

stuff.",45
Joey," Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.",10
Rachel," Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store?

I'll help you out.",19
Phoebe," Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the

hospital.",14
Phoebe," Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.",13
Phoebe," It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like

I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.",24
Phoebe," Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the

coffeehouse!",16
Monica," (entering, in a hurry) Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a

car right outside.",18
Phoebe," It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like

y'know, one life ends and another begins.",18
Monica," (to the guys) Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did

she die?",16
Phoebe," Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some

yogurt and she just never came back up again.",24
Phoebe," It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; ""Okay dear,

you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout

counter."" And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.",42
Rachel," Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff

right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?",22
Joey," All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.",12
Rachel," Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. (Goes and grabs a

bag, that looks like a purse, and shows it to Joey.)",24
Rachel," No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring

catalog. Look. (Shows him.) See look, men, carrying the bag.",24
Joey," See look, women, carrying the bag. (He puts it on his shoulder and

looks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.) But it is odd how a women's purse

looks good on me, a man.",38
Joey, Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.,11
Phoebe," Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?",12
Phoebe," No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service

tomorrow.",13
Phoebe," Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?",13
Joey," What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just

looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your

stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!",37
Rachel," (entering) Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not

until tomorrow.",15
Joey," Yeah, but sandwich time is right now. (Removes a sandwich and starts

eating.)",13
Rachel," Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.",13
Joey," Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard? (He's holding the fake credit cards

that come with the bag.)",18
Joey," All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am

definitely gonna get thanks to you.",22
Phoebe," Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look,

here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.",29
Phoebe," (notices his bag.) Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!",13
Joey," Here, I brought you some flowers. (He pulls them out of the bag.)",13
Chandler, Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.,12
Joey," (approaches, wearing his glasses) Hey you guys, check it out. Check it

out. (Moves his hand towards and away from his face.) It's like it's coming right at me.

(Chandler helps out a little bit by pushing on Joey's arm, which causes his hand to slap

him in his face.)",50
Phoebe," He said, ""Nice to meet you Glenda."" (They stare at her,

dumbfounded) Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?",21
Phoebe," Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's

gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!",26
Phoebe," Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of

Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house

later.",34
Phoebe," All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna

say good-bye to my Grandma.",19
Joey," (entering, with bag) Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?",13
Rachel," Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that

part.",14
Joey," Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And

it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't

make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact

that Joey, (pats the bag) comes with a bag! (Exits.)",59
Phoebe," All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.",14
Rachel," Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?",15
Phoebe," Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out",13
Ross," Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you!

I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger!

(Getting worked up) I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, ""Yo, dad! You and

me outside right now!"" (Calming down.) I kinda scared myself.",57
Phoebe," Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think

I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.",24
Monica," Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you. ",12
Phoebe," Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!",15
Phoebe," As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!",14
Monica," (indignant) I give good massages! (Ross laughs.) I used to give them to

Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch! (She

starts giving Chandler a massage.)",32
Phoebe," (seeing the look on Chandler's face) He-he does not like it! He hates

it! He's in pain!",17
Monica, You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.,11
Ross," Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.",10
Monica," But the minute we start to lie to each other… (Pauses after she

realizes what she's saying.) And by 'we' I mean society.",23
Joey," (reading from the script) Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a

table and I'll buy you a drink.",22
Joey," Yeah, sure. (He takes it off and starts reading.) Well, you must be new

here. Maybe we should—I'm sorry, can I ask you something? (He stops and asks a

question.)",30
Joey," I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's

bag!",15
Joey," All right look, let me show you the catalog! (Does so.) See? Huh? It's the

latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!",26
Joey," Okay! All right, I'll see ya. (As he's walking off stage.) (Patting the

bag.) We got it! We got it!",20
Chandler," (coming all the way in) Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this

afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.",24
Monica," Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I

just wish you could tell me—just say, ""I don't like your massages.""",25
Monica," I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at

work.",13
Monica, (bursting into tears) My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.,11
Chandler," It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.",11
Chandler," Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If

anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves,

""Who's the best of that?"" They'd have to go to you.",37
Monica," Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad

massage, well who would get that?",21
Chandler," Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!",13
Monica," So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?",10
Phoebe," Come, sit. (He's hesitant.) Sit. (Still hesitating.) Sit! (He sits on

the arm of the couch.) Umm, all righty, before we get started I just—I need you to

state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.",40
Phoebe," Oh yes. Yes. Yeah—no. She did. She left you umm, (looking in her

purse) this lipstick.",16
Phoebe," Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my

official forms. (She picks up a couple of crumpled receipts.) Okay, so, question 1) You

and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?",43
Phoebe," Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium,

or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?",25
Phoebe," Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A.

Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad,

bad man?",26
Phoebe," Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.",11
Phoebe," Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe,

(pause) is on this couch.",17
Phoebe," Y'know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it's not gonna make a

difference anyway, so you can just go.",20
Joey, Estelle said I didn't get it. (Sits down next to Rachel on the couch.),14
Joey," Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems

with me.",16
Joey," Well to tell you the truth, they uh, (Pause) they had a problem with the

bag!",16
Monica," Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.",11
Joey," I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach?

(She's avoiding his eyes.) Oh, you think I should give up the bag!",31
Rachel," Honey wait, Joey, I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are

with it… (Looks for help.)",19
Rachel, …I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.,14
Rachel," Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn’t

have a bag, I just—it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, (Pause)

controversial.",30
Joey," You're right. You're right. This bag has 

become like a part of me. You know? It's like...my bag. (Ross nods.) You know, I 

had a place for everything. It- (starts looking in it frantically) Oh Man!",36
Joey," There's a whole series of pockets here I 

didn't even know about, Rach. Look. (starts to cry) ",17
Phoebe," Ursula, I have the most amazing news. I 

found our dad. (listens) Phoebe! (listens) Your sister. And I found our dad. 

(listens) John Glenn? John Glenn is not our dad. (listens) No, I will not join 

you in the lawsuit against him. (listens) But, it-(listens) it doesn't matter 

that he wasn't there while we were growing up. He's not our father! (listens) 

What do you mean that's for a jury to decide? ",72
Phoebe," (looking out the window) Oh hey, you guys,

look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!",17
Rachel," I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy

is moving.",12
Ross," Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled

clothes.",10
Ross," Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to

get his place!",13
Ross, It would be so cool to live across from you guys!,11
Joey," Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing!

Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a

string!",24
Monica," Uh-oh. He's got

packing tape stuck to where you really don't want it.",13
Joey," Take it from me,

if you're going to be pulling tape off yourself it's gotta be in

one quick motion.",20
Ross," Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it

perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!",20
Rachel," Well that is because your eye immediately goes

to the big naked man.",13
Phoebe," It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out

an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.",18
Ross," (laughing) Ohh. (Phoebe takes a couple of steps

to the door and Ross quickly hurries out.)",16
Rachel," Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm

gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom. (Does so.)",18
Phoebe," (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's

Monica and Chandler! (Starts yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!

(Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes off.)

Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!",29
Rachel," Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't

know so you have to stop screaming!!",16
Rachel," (trying to divert his attention from the window

by jumping up and down) HI!! Hi! ",15
Rachel," Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you

want to get this apartment!",14
Ross," Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards

the window and now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his

attention.)",18
Phoebe," (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!!

(Motions to join her and Rachel.)",11
Phoebe," You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where

like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or—Oh!

All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!",29
Phoebe," Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's

great! For him. She might be able to do better.",21
Joey," You mean how they're friends and nothing more?

(Glares at Rachel.)",11
Rachel," No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly

Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the

window. (Joey gasps) Actually, we saw them doing it up against

the window.",32
Phoebe," You know we saw them

fornicating! Okay, so now they know that you know and they

don't know that Rachel knows?",21
Joey," Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows

what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we

know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!",35
Phoebe," Or, we could not tell them we know and

have a little fun of our own.",16
Phoebe," Well y'know every time that they say that like

they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to

do.",22
Joey," No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would

even be more fun? Telling them.",14
Joey," So we'll make it

fun, we'll do it like a- like a barbershop quartet. 'We know

(points to him) we know (points to Rachel) we know (points to

Phoebe)!"" (Smiles at the end)",33
Phoebe," No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't

tell them that we know!",14
Joey," Noo! I can't take any more secrets! (To Rachel)

I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of

my own y'know!",24
Joey," Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my

bedtime penguin pal. (Joey shies away.)",15
Rachel," (To Phoebe) So umm, how-how are we gonna mess

with them?",11
Phoebe," Well, you could use your position y'know as the

roommate.",10
Phoebe," And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool

at my disposal. My sexuality.",14
Phoebe," (feels his arm) Yeah the material feels so

soft—hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?",16
Chandler," Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things.

(Phoebe giggles uncontrollably.) Are you okay?",13
Phoebe," Well, if you really wanna know, I'm—Oh! I

can't tell you this.",12
Phoebe," Well actually you're the one person I can't

tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.",20
Phoebe," I think it's just y'know that I haven't been

with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for

something and you just don’t even see that it's right there

in front of you sipping coffee—Oh no, have I said to much?

Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.",55
Monica, You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?,12
Chandler," Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my

Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.",14
Chandler," Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must

say.",10
Chandler," The weirdest thing happened at the coffee

house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.",17
Monica," I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought

you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.",21
Chandler," No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all

over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!",18
Chandler," Well it's not flexed right now! Why is it so hard for you to believe that Phoebe

could be attracted to me?",22
Monica," It's not. All

the girls are attracted to you. You're part bunny.",12
Rachel," Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see

a movie with us?",14
Rachel," Okay great, hold on a sec! (She runs to her

room and returns carrying a huge bag of laundry.) Oh, here you

go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot!

Thanks!",37
Monica," I mean I-I don't I think I have enough

quarters.",10
Phoebe," I have quarters! (She holds up a bag of

quarters.)",10
Ross," Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly

Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a

hundred applicants.",24
Ross," No-no cause you know the

difference between them and me is?",11
Ross," (To Chandler) I trusted you man! (To the rest)

Anyway, the difference is I got the edge. I know it's not

exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to tip the scales

in my direction. Check it out, you can probably see it from the

window. (They all head to the window.)",54
Monica," Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow

on it?",12
Phoebe," But there's a whole table of mini-muffin

baskets. Which one did you send?",13
Rachel," What?! You-you actually thought that basket was

gonna get you the apartment?",12
Ross," Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once

and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best

day.",23
Ross," Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure

that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!

(Exits.)",24
Rachel," All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna

catch that movie.",12
Phoebe," Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.)

I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.)",16
Chandler," (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?!

With the inappropriate and the pinching!!",14
Chandler," Okay, so now do you believe that she's

attracted to me?",11
Monica," Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!",11
Monica," Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us

out! That's the only explanation for it!",16
Chandler," (a little hurt) Okay but what about y'know my

pinchable butt and my bulging biceps—She knows!",16
Joey," And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me

promise not to tell!",14
Joey," I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because

you can tell them that you know they know and I can go

back to knowing absolutely nothing!",27
Monica," Oh man, they think they are so slick

messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they

know! So…",23
Joey," Come on you guys.

I-I...Think-think about how much fun it would be to tell. (does

the barbershop quartet thing again) 'We know, we know, we know'.",26
Ross," Look I've already looked at like a thousand

apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!

Well except for one, but I would've had to

share it with our Armenian family. Grandma really liked me. But I

want Ugly Naked Apartment!!!",45
Rachel," You should find out what his hobbies are and

then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a

conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.",34
Ross," That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy

because we've been watching him for like five years so that

gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.",35
Ross," Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will

figure something out. (He opens the door and stops.) Hey, didn't

he used to have a cat?",28
Phoebe," I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably

just bum him out.",12
Rachel," Hello! (Listens) Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second

she's right here! (To Phoebe) It's Chandler.",16
Phoebe," (in a sexy voice) Oh? (Takes the phone from

Rachel.) Hello you.",12
Chandler," Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you

all day. (He's holding the phone so that Monica can hear it as

well.)",21
Chandler," Well you know that thing you said before, I'd

be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.",17
Chandler," Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here

tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my

bicep. Or maybe more.",25
Phoebe," I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay,

bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his

bicep and more!",28
Rachel," I can not believe he would do that to

Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at

Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we

know?",32
Joey," (disappointed) I

would say 'Thank god! Everybody knows. It's finally over.' But

that hasn't been working for me.",18
Phoebe," God, they thought they can mess with us!

They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know

they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey, you can't

say anything!",34
Ross," Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm

one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize

that the competition is fierce but—I'm sorry. I, I can't

help but notice you're naked and (He claps his hands.) I applaud

you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great.

That is how God intended it.",62
Monica," (in the kitchen with Chandler) Look at them,

they're-they're panicked!",10
Phoebe," All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's

gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.",20
Phoebe," Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me

having sexual intercourse.",12
Joey," (looking out the window) Hey-hey, check it out!

Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!",18
Rachel," Oh yeah! (She gasps.) Oh my God! That is our

friend! (Monica covers her face.) It's Naked Ross! (Monica turns

and buries her face in Chandler's shoulder.)",27
Ross," Would you like

another mini muffin? Try the blueberry, they're delicious.",11
Phoebe," And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?

(He begrudgingly does so.)",14
Phoebe," All right.

Thanks. But umm, glasses that do not have handles and that are

glass. And umm wine that is not olive oil.",23
Monica," All right, it'll be great! You just make her

think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!",21
Chandler," Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go

with her?",12
Monica," Because you're on my team! And my team always

wins!",10
Monica," Just go get some! (Kisses him.) Go! (She runs

to hide in the bathroom.)",14
Rachel," (handing her the wine) Okay honey, now I'm

gonna try to listen from right here!",15
Rachel," Okay? Whoa, wait! (She undoes one button on

Phoebe's dress.)",10
Phoebe," I was going too. (They go inside and he closes

the door.) Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?",21
Chandler," I'm gonna put on some music. (He does and unknowningly it's some haunting

music in which Phoebe and Rachel, who is listening outside the

apartment, are confused) Joey likes to scare the duck. (He puts on some romantic music.)",39
Phoebe," Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you. (She starts

doing a rather suggestive and seductive dance that's silly at the

same time.)",21
Phoebe," Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like

that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!",19
Phoebe," No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take

off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.",20
Chandler," (swallowing hard) Well that would be nice.

I'll go get the lotion.",12
Chandler," Listen, this is totally getting out of hand!

Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her! ",17
Chandler," Look, she's not backing down! She went like

this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)",17
Rachel," It's Chandler,

you-you can take him. I mean come on, don't you remember when you

made him cry using only your words?",22
Joey," (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done

yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!",16
Rachel," Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner

Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the

open.",24
Joey," I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your

bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open

the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)",30
Phoebe," Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you

didn’t rip off any buttons.",11
Monica," You go back out there and you seduce her till

she cracks!",12
Chandler," Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean

up in here?",12
Phoebe," Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks

over to him and is showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.",21
Chandler," (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well,

come here. I'm very happy were gonna be having all the sex.",19
Phoebe," You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm

gonna kiss you now.",12
Chandler," Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to

do but-but kiss.",12
Chandler," Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't

have sex with ya!",13
Chandler," Love her! That's right,

I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and

hug.) I love you, Monica.",17
Phoebe," I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I

didn't know you were in love!",15
Chandler," And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.

(Pause) And might I say your breasts are still showing.",18
Chandler," Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told

him yet.",11
Ross," Well here it is. A

new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys

from work over once it's y'know, furnished.",26
Ross," Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is

definitely behind me.",13
Ross," Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally

ready to come back to work. I—What? (He notices something

through the window.) No! Wh… What are you doing?!! (Dr.

Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY

SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!! ",38
Ross," Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped

by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.)

Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were

doing to my sister! Now get out here!",51
Chandler," (To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five

months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care,

bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window.)",43
Monica," Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. (They go to the door. Ross

is trying to stick his hand through and undo the chain; Monica pushes his hand back.) (To

Ross) Hold on! (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?",44
Rachel," (running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's

going on?!",13
Chandler," Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.",11
Ross," (To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My

best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!",23
Chandler," Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love

with her.",15
Monica," I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's

true, I love him too.",20
Ross," (happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs

them both.) (To Joey and Rachel) You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big

news!",31
Rachel," Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.",10
Ross," What? What? What?! You guys knew? (Joey and Rachel backup against the

door.) You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!",21
Rachel," Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going

to react.",16
Ross," (happily again) You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going

to react? (He hugs them both.)",20
Joey," Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let

these two lovebirds get back down to business? (Ross turns and glares at him.)

Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.",41
Ross," Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids…",13
Ross," You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should

be Godfather?",13
Rachel," Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.",13
Phoebe," Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.",13
Rachel, She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!,13
Phoebe," She could fit in that little pocket 

inside the pocket. ",10
Joey," I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but…",15
Joey," Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? (Quietly) She-she-she's

hurting me.",13
Monica," I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing

after preschool?",17
Chandler," Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is

beating him up.",16
Rachel," Aww, Joey, come here. (She takes his hand.) Look honey, I know this must

be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?",28
Phoebe," And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.",10
Ross, Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.,10
Ross," No-no, it's not that, it's just… I-I just moved in.",10
Ross," No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met

Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.",19
Ross," …so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and

now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! 

And told me to wipe it off with my $100 bill.",36
Chandler," (looks at Ross' knee) You should 

really wipe it off with something.",12
Ross," Y'know what I'm gonna do?

I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit

them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy

who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.",55
Rachel," Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you

just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.",28
Ross, It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!,11
Rachel," Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.",10
Ross," Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta

run. I gotta go get some nametags. (Exits.)",22
Chandler," Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I

don't want you putting any ideas in her head.",23
Rachel," Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably

already in Monica's head.",14
Rachel," Well, because she loves you and because you love her.",10
Rachel," Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already

know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's

a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.",38
Chandler," I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one

that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then

the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?!

I’m right. I'm right. Am I right?",56
Chandler," Okay. An-an-and you know I'm 

completely different from Richard anyway. Because he's an eye doctor, and I 

don't wear glasses. ",20
Rachel," No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that

makes everything different.",15
Joey," (sets the coffee down) Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.",10
Joey," Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like

you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully

punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real

bat.",49
Monica," Couldn't you just stay like this forever? (His eyes snap open.)

Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?",18
Chandler," I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that

I'm seeing casually.",15
Monica," Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!",12
Monica," Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around

about marriage and stuff.",16
Chandler," Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and

everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn

down the heat on this pressure cooker?!",32
Monica," Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about

you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!",21
Chandler," Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the

head--in your head!",17
Monica," You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel

tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And

did you know that I can't even look at you right now?! (She storms out.)",46
Chandler," It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is,

this is fixable.",17
Monica," Gunther, can I get a coffee (Looks at Chandler) to go?",11
Monica, I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.,10
Chandler, Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.,12
Chandler," Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how

to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.",31
Monica," Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna

have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be

in a real relationship, then don't be in one. (She walks out.)",40
Phoebe," Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it’s a party for

Howard. He's just the sweetest little man! (A guest walks up to her.)",28
Ross," Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was

totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!",23
Phoebe," Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the

exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.",21
Phoebe," No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you

talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!",21
Joey," Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing

six sweaters?",15
Joey," Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra

padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's

gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?",45
Rachel," Oh! Oh, right. I forgot that you call it 

that. ",10
Rachel," Whoa! (Laughs) Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are

the one who is too much. (She punches Katie back.)",23
Rachel," Ohh, you're so sweet! (She kicks Katie in the shin.)",10
Phoebe," (ignoring him and continuing her conversation) That's what I'm saying.

(Laughs.)",11
Ross," Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?",10
Phoebe," No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all

right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?",22
Phoebe," Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some

sympathy.",15
Phoebe," Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because

I don't totally understand what happened there.",21
Ross," (trying a piece of cake) Ohh, this cake is really good!",11
Phoebe," All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that

I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? (Ross is the only one who raises his hand and

Phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you don't like him! He-he

didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, ""Who hear likes

Ross,"" and he's wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-I'll be honest with you

guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I

saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is

don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now,

but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind

numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something

woman, who're a couple.) (To the girl) Gold-digger, (To the old guy) cradle robbing perv!

So, I think you all know what I mean.",191
Phoebe," Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just

thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you

could look like the hero.",33
Chandler," Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is

she here?",16
Chandler," Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh,

us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly and

awkwardly gets down on one knee.)",38
Chandler, I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.,12
Monica," Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because

you're sorry?",16
Chandler," No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much

fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (Laughs.)

Will you be my wife?",30
Monica," (kneels with him) Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I

want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.",24
Monica," Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never

said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!",27
Chandler," Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these

guys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)",22
Monica," Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this

relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.",26
Monica," Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?",11
Chandler," Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the

rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole

in that door. (Points at the door.)",38
Joey," Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.",12
Phoebe," Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to

you last week.",20
Rachel," Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to

move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?",24
Monica," Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you

were so, a long time.",19
Ross," This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole ""We were on a break

thing?"" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? (Laughs--whines as he sees that no one is

laughing. They're just staring at him in shock.)",37
Chandler," Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do

you know a six-letter word for red?",21
Chandler," Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for

you later. (To Monica) Hey, how about maroon?",22
Monica," (checks to see if it works) Yes, you are so smart! (Kisses him.)",13
Rachel," (looking at the bill) Uhh, we still need a tip.",10
Phoebe," All right. Hold on. (She starts digging in the chair.) I got it. Nickel!

(Donates it.) How much more do we need?",22
Phoebe," Okay, dime! (Donates that.) You guys should probably keep talking; this

could take a while. (Finds something else.) Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! (Looks at it.) Oh

my God, this is a police badge!",35
Chandler," Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't

serve donuts. (No one laughs.) Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I

think I can come up with something better than that.",39
Phoebe," Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm

at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy

has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! (She crosses her fingers in

hope.)",48
Monica," Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?",16
Joey," Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's

sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I’m not him.",22
Joey, No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!,11
Joey," No! No, you smell like a meadow. (Pause.) I'm sorry. (Runs to the

bathroom.)",14
Chandler," Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was

shot by a hunter.",18
Phoebe," Hey, look-look what I found. It's a 

police badge. (shows him the police badge)",14
Ross," Oh, what's that doing here? I don't see 

any doughnuts. (He's the only one that laughs.) Cops and donuts. Come on. Ohh 

okay, alright if Chandler had said it you'd be all on the floor. ",35
Chandler," Cops, doughnuts? Me? (scoffs and 

motions for Monica not to say anything.) ",12
Ross," (To Rachel) Yeah, I still don't know. (To the salesman who is hovering

nearby) I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch

that says, ""Kids welcome here."" But that also says, (In a sexy voice) ""Come

here to me!""",48
Ross," No! No! No! The ""Come here to me"" is y'know for the ladies.",13
Rachel," Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.",11
Ross," Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as

the couch!",15
Rachel," Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!",11
Ross," Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! (He signs the form and

hands it back to the salesman.) All right Rach, let's go! (He picks up one end of the

couch.)",33
Rachel," Yeah! (She puts on her coat and turns around and sees Ross is expecting

her to help.) (Laughing.) Are you kiddin'?",21
Ross," Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it!

Come on! Come on!",18
Rachel," (Disgustedly she goes and tries to pick up the couch. Much to her

amazement, she is successful.) Oh. Oh! I can do it!",23
Ross," Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together. (He starts backing out of the

store.)",15
Ross," Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.",12
Rachel," Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a

very heavy couch.",19
Ross," Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!",11
Rachel, Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!,11
Ross, A loser you did it with (To the salesman) 298 times!,11
Phoebe," Yeah that's right you are so busted. (To no one in particular.) Book

'em.",14
Phoebe," Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you

apologize to the tree.",17
Phoebe," You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. (The

woman calls her bluff.) (Screaming at no one in particular) Backup! Backup!!",26
Rachel," Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?",11
Ross," Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.",11
Rachel," Oh, then wait. Don't you think we should 

maybe rethink the whole hiring movers thing? ",15
Ross," No way! They're a rip-off! And-and you 

know what else? They check out your stuff and come back later and steal it. It's 

true. I saw it on Dateline. ",29
Rachel," Oh, I love Dateline. You know, 

Jane Pauley is the one woman I would kiss. I don't know, there's just something 

about her.",23
Ross," Okay, go left. Left! Left! (The bottom of the couch is hitting the

railing.)",14
Ross," Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head!

You can do it! You can do it! (She gets it lifted up and they make the first turn.) Okay.

You got it?",37
Ross," Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it? ",12
Phoebe," …so this guy was all (Mumbles.) And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide.

(Flashes the badge.) It was just so cool!",19
Monica," (cooking something) Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!",10
Phoebe, I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.,11
Chandler," Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could

get arrested.",14
Phoebe," You could get arrested, right now! (Flashes the badge and they glare at

her.) All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. (She heads for

the door just as Joey enters.)",36
Joey," Yeah, I didn’t know you guys were going to be here.",11
Monica," Hey Joey, do me a favor sweetie, taste this. (Holds out a spoon for him.)",15
Joey," Uh, actually I was uh looking for Phoebe. 

(moves his head as if he is trying to spot her) ",19
Joey," I gotta go. (starts to leave but Monica 

prevents him from doing so)",13
Monica," All right Joey, wait a minute. Wait.

What is going on with you?",13
Joey," All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, (pause) but I don't

want to talk about it. (Starts for his room.)",23
Chandler," Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said

that? (Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) I kinda have a dream! I

don’t want to talk about it.",28
Chandler," You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!

(To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.

(Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway we're talking about your dream. (To Monica) I

love you. (To Joey) Your dream? (Leans in to listen closely.)",59
Joey," Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt

about her like that since I found out about you two--ish. ",24
Joey," Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword

puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica

and I'll be moving out. (tries to head to his room but stops him from doing so)",46
Monica," Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn’t mean that-that you're in love with

me!",12
Chandler," No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous

because I've become the apartment stud.",19
Monica," Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we

y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.",30
Joey," Well if that's what it was, that'd be 

great. I wouldn't have to move.",14
Chandler," Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are

you attracted to her?",16
Monica," Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! (Looking at Chandler and slowly

realizing what his point is.) But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you

just want a girlfriend!",32
Joey," No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I

mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but

y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?",45
Chandler," Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started

dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?",15
Rachel," (entering) Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?",10
Phoebe," Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're

blocking the entrance. ",17
Phoebe," Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause

I'm a cop. (Shows the badge.)",20
Phoebe," Ohh, no. (Pause) Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park

anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work.

10-4. (Tries to leave.)",36
Phoebe," I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.",13
Phoebe," (starts to walk away, but stops) Don’t try to call him or anything,

'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.",25
Phoebe," Oh. (She starts laughing. Then she throws the badge at him and runs

away.)",14
Rachel," Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?",14
Joey," Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can

blow that off, (In a sexy voice) for you.",25
Joey," Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking

to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.",24
Joey," Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm

thinking of getting me one of those.",20
Joey," Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great…",11
Joey," …is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself,

""Who are my friends?"" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So…",24
Joey, I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.,11
Rachel," Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me

first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.",28
Joey, I'll treat you real nice. (Pulls out a chair for her.),11
Rachel," (laughs and pushes the chair back in) Yeah, well, y'know umm… No

honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you

date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend,

build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!",62
Rachel," Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.",14
Joey," Yeah. I understand. I understand. (Pause) Man, I wish I saw Phoebe

first!",13
Ross," Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.",10
Ross, Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!,11
Chandler," Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so…",11
Ross," Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. (Showing them) Okay

Rach, (points to the sketch) that's you. That's the couch. (Points again.) ",26
Chandler," (looking at the sketch) Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really

liked your new couch.",17
Ross," All right. (They start up the stairs. Ross is first.) Okay, here we go!",14
Rachel," Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.",11
Ross," Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! (They

start up the stairs again. Chandler is between the couch and the wall now.) Pivot! Piv-ot!

Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!",34
Ross," All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.",12
Rachel," I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!",10
Chandler," Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?",10
Monica," (sitting on the other barcalounger) Yeah 

because it's not 1985.",10
Phoebe," Well, he caught me using his badge and 

he tried to bust me. Damn real cops!",16
Phoebe," Well, he didn't really. He just-he 

picked up his badge and-and stood there. ",13
Chandler," Well maybe, we'll see you on 

World's Most Boring Police Chases. ",11
Phoebe," I had to. Y-you know, impersonating a 

cop is like a Class E felony. That's two to four years minimum. I am not going 

back to that hellhole. ",28
Ross," If I can just get it to pivot we'll 

be back on track! Rach-Rach, can I get some help please?",20
Rachel," Yeah. (She pulls herself up by holding 

on the arm of the couch and pulling on the fire alarm. The fire alarm goes off.)

",24
Ross," Turn it off! Turn it off! (Rachel tries to 

do but ends up breaking it.) ",15
Rachel," Oh, hey! Maybe the firemen can help us 

move the couch when they get here. (Ross just stares at her.) (Other tenants 

coming running down the stairs over the couch.) Wait, wait, wait! ",33
Ross," Wait, wait, wait! It's a new couch! It's a 

new couch! (some how someone hurts him) Oww! A new couch! (No one listens and 

continuing stepping on the couch and in the process breaks one of the arms of 

the couch.) ",41
Rachel, Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?,10
Joey," Yeah, yeah, I met this woman. (Starts for his room.)",10
Monica," Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!",11
Joey," Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As

soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I

suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! (Pause) And her

roommate!",47
Joey, Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!,10
Joey," (taking a bite) Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?

",15
Phoebe," Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!",15
Rachel," Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!",10
Phoebe," Well, if I'm going down, you guys are going down (Points at all of them) with me.

(They all look at her.) Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck

Chandler. (She opens the door to the cop from before.) Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But

you'll never make it stick and you know it!",59
Phoebe," Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once

he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!",30
Phoebe, Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!,10
Phoebe," Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer…",10
Phoebe," Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find

me?",15
Ross, I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.,11
Ross," This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one

that is not cut in half!",20
Ross," Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.",11
Rachel," Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!",10
Joey," I got this pair marked XS, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for

excess anything in there.",19
Rachel," Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll

work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!",24
Phoebe," Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!",10
Phoebe," Okay. (They shake hands and she pulls away suddenly) Oh my God! What did

I ever do to you?! (Rubbing her hand.)",22
Joey," That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see

me! Same as yesterday, (To Monica) same as the day before.",26
Joey," (waving) Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. (Notices that a

woman is waving back.) Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. (She just stares at him.)

(Joey sees how beautiful she is.) Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in

Ross's building is flirting with me.",52
Joey," Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. (He turns back to the woman.) Okay, here

goes. (Thinks.) How (Holds up his hand like an Indian) you (Points at her) a-doin'? (Does

a little twisting motion with both hands and ends up pointing at her, he then winks. She

smiles and waves again.) (To Monica) It worked! She's waving me over. (Towards the woman.)

Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor…",73
Joey," Tell me about it, huh? (Realizes that she can see Monica.) Oh no-no-no,

I'm not with her, she's just Monica! (He pantomimes that out.) Ewwuck! (He pushes Monica

away and makes a disgusted face.)",34
Ross," Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can

pretend to be surfing. (He pretends he's surfing by the window.)",26
Joey," But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! (Runs away.)",13
Joey," I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something.

(Looks out the window.) Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his

'Watching TV' bit. (We see Ross sitting on the couch and flipping through the channels on

his remote.)",46
Phoebe," But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause

some guy shot at a store clerk.",22
Monica," Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?",11
Phoebe," Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this

little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shoots bad guys. Ohh, I just love

beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each

other.",47
Phoebe, So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?,10
Monica," I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.",14
Phoebe," Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.",14
Monica," (Start annoying hyper-competitive mode now.) (Jumping up) What don't you

just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don’t you just get all your facts before you

run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!",36
Phoebe," (Under her breath) God, I woke the beast. Sorry. (To Monica) I was wrong

obviously, I just—I misspoke. It's okay.",20
Monica," Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I

are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!",35
Monica, You are so cute. (She goes over and kisses him passionately.),11
Chandler," Wow, the cute bar keeps getting lower 

and lower, doesn't it? (They kiss again.)",14
Joey," Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall

right out of your chair?",21
Joey," Well that explains why you didn't do the 

other stuff. ",10
Rachel," Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I

even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, ""Well, yeah! If

you've got enough life jackets!"" (She starts laughing; Chandler and Joey are not

amused.) Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye

and ugh!",61
Rachel," (We see a flashback as Rachel describes what happened.) All right, we

were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me… Y'know maybe he was going to open

the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh… (The flashback shows that she

kissed him on the cheek.)",49
Monica," (entering from the bathroom) Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren

called, you got a second interview!",17
Monica," Oh okay. Umm, (does a little cheer dance 

and chant to go with it) A guy from Ralph Lauren called. You got a second 

interview.",25
Rachel, Oh my God! I can't believe it! I got a second interview!,12
Joey," I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?",14
Rachel," What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?",13
Rachel," I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back

y'know of course, 'cause ""Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!""",25
Rachel," Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just

sleep with him?",18
Monica, He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.,11
Rachel," Maybe. I-I don't know—Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!",11
Joey," Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey.

Come on. Come on. (She hugs him and Joey looks out the window.) She's back! Hot girl's

back!",33
Rachel," Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.",10
Joey," No, in Ross's building! (He throws Rachel onto the chair and heads to the

window.) She's back! She's back! (Pantomimes) Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second.

(He counts where she is again.) Got it! (Runs out and does a little hop over a chair.)",47
Chandler," I gotta check out this hot girl! (He heads to the window but realizes

something, stops, turns and points at Monica.) There she is! (He dances over to her and

kisses her.)",32
Ross," Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. (Joey

just stares at him) I'm Ross.",22
Joey, (Looking around) Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?,13
Joey," Yeah. Sorry about that. (He walks away and knocks on the next door which

is answered by a little girl.) Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or

babysitter by any chance a hot girl?",38
Joey," Later! (He runs away down the hall and hides behind a corner to a whole

other corridor.) Oh man! (Walks down the hallway in desperation.) Hot girl! Hot girl!!",29
Rachel," (stopping him) Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going

on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not

some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I (He tries to

interrupt and tell her about the ink), hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does

not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that

bad. Good day, sir. (She storms out of his office.) (to a 

girl who is sitting outside his office) If you're going in there to see Mr. 

Zelner, I hope you're ready to put out. (leaves)",115
Rachel," (entering) Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph

Lauren did too me!",15
Chandler," (To Gary) So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?",13
Chandler," Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you… (He gestures and spills

some of his coffee.)",16
Monica," Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?",12
Phoebe," Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so

amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.",27
Monica," (That annoying competitiveness thing kicks in again, what the heck is

that with her and why must the writers show it every flippin' episode?!) Oh, we're not

seeing a movie!",30
Phoebe, You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?,13
Monica," Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and

Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?",31
Monica," Okay. (She gets up and walks over to Chandler.) Chandler? Can I see you

for a second?",17
Monica," Okay. (They walk away to get some privacy.) We have got to beat

them! {Here we go yet again.}",19
Monica," 'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!",12
Monica," So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them

wrong!",17
Chandler," Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's

crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go

upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.",45
Ross, (to the woman checking her mail next to him) Hey!,10
Ross," Jen, I know this may sound a little…(makes some kind of crazy noise)

But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or…",26
Monica, Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.,11
Monica," We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the

best.",15
Joey," (entering) Hey guys! (Sees their state of undress) What 'cha been doin'?

(Has a silly grin.)",16
Monica," (looking out the window) Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you

the other day?",17
Joey," I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. (He looks out the window.)

Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her

anyway.",32
Joey," Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of

hot girl parallel universe, or something.",19
Monica," What are you talking about? (Pointing out the window.) She obviously

lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!",21
Joey," No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment

from the left.",14
Monica," No, those first two windows, (Points) that's the lobby. And y'know the

other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.",23
Joey," I did not know that! Thank you Monica. (Starts to leave) I can't

believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.",22
Ross," Sure. (He opens the door to Joey. Needless to say, Joey's stunned.)

Joey…",13
Joey, Dahhhhh!! (Ross has a puzzled look on his face.) No! Noooo!! (Storms off.),13
Rachel," Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.",15
Rachel," (looks around for the camera) Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to

start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.",25
Rachel," Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, (She

puts her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. Rachel then doesn't know where to put

her hands.) who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big

mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage.

When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity.

And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. (Suddenly realizes

that she said courage twice.) Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you

gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in

the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to

litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.  So she didn't want to sue him.

  Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got (counts

them off with her fingers) courage, you got integrity, you got (Pause) courage again, and

not litigious. Look Mr…",208
Rachel," Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think,

I think I would be really good at it.",23
Rachel," Really? Oh thank you! Oh… Oh, would it be completely inappropriate

to give you a hug?",16
Rachel," Okay, well then how about a handshake? (She goes to shake his hand but

misses and touches his groin.) Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to

touch that—I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going

to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so—Hey! I'll see you Monday!

(Exits.)",61
Monica," You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I

mean. You know what I mean?",21
Chandler," Oh yeah, it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to the

lining.) Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. (Pause, softly) That's pee-pee.

(Heads for the bathroom.)",33
Phoebe," Ohh, (laughs) umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.",14
Phoebe, We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!,12
Monica," I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second! (Gets up and heads for the

bathroom as that annoying Gotta-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.)",24
Monica," Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual.

Haven't you?",15
Chandler," No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out.

Okay, I don't want to disappoint you and I really 

don't want to disappoint the guy in the second stall (a man walks out of the 

stall) Sorry, man. (The man leaves.) But come on, this is getting 

ridiculous!",51
Chandler," Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you

getting so obsessed about this thing?!",20
Chandler, Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?,10
Monica," Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other

all the time?",17
Chandler," Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth,

I'm more excited about where we are right now.",23
Chandler," Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long

before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I

think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I

think that's pretty exciting. (Kisses her.)",50
Monica," That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I

feel the same way.",20
Chandler," Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our

relationship.",12
Chandler," Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have

switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational

screw up! (Does a dance of joy.) (Monica glares at him.) And now we're back.",42
Rachel," Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine. ",13
Ross," (from his apartment) Man! They cannot get enough! (Makes like he's a robot

and waves at the cutouts.)",18
Joey, (holding up the Queen of Clubs) Is that your card? (He winks and smiles.),14
Ross," (sets Ben down) Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the

park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave

us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.",47
Joey," (reading the card) Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting

director in town! (Ross gasps) Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!

(Ross and Carol stare at him, then Joey realizes what he just said.) I mean, way to go

Ben! (Gives Ben the thumbs up, which Ben returns.) Man! I've been in that park a million

times and no one offered me an audition.",72
Ross," I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings…",12
Joey, I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!,10
Rachel," (entering from her room) Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!",10
Chandler," Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you

bring me back some of those polo shirts?",19
Rachel," Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my

very first day…",17
Monica," Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.",11
Phoebe," Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party

this weekend.",14
Phoebe," Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a

surprise.",16
Monica," I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just

invite her close friends.",19
Phoebe," Okay, great so do you want to do it together?",10
Ross," All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big

audition.",17
Monica, It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.,13
Chandler," Weirder than watching his two moms make out? (Monica nods in

agreement.)",12
Ross, Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.,12
Joey," Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an

audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.",32
Ross," (Pause) Of course I am! (Joey is relieved) Okay, let's go godfather.",12
Joey," I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has 

actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her. 

Hey, and the other one I know from...(smiles)..well you know. (Ross smiles too.)

",39
Joey," Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar

Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in

that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad….",43
Ross," Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I

mean look at him, look at you, (Starts to whine like a baby and Joey just glares at him.)",35
Joey," That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's

dad?",15
Joey, I look more like him than you do! (He winks at Carol.),12
Rachel," Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric (On

the other one.) Sorry.",20
Rachel," Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror

stories…(stops and tries to change directions)…about ghosts and goblins who

totally supported the princess's right to smoke.",31
Rachel," …and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the

decisions without me!",17
Rachel," I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting,

poisoning habit!",14
Rachel," I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside

smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid

clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do

you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?",55
Chandler," You know, we used to have a smoking 

area at work. It was great. There was this big flowerpot with dirt in it. And we 

used to like put our cigarettes out in it. And one of the old-timers told me 

there used to be a little tree in there. ",50
Monica," Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you

wanna get some fresh air.",19
Chandler," Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.

You gotta take long, deep drags. (pretends he is taking 

one and then coughs) Wow, I still don't have my lung capacity back yet. (Monica 

pats him easy on the back.)",41
Phoebe," Oh wait, I change my mind! (She slams the door on them.) Okay, let's

talk about the party! I have so many ideas! (Holds up a cocktail napkin.)",28
Monica," Yeah, me too! (Runs and grabs her 3-ring binder of ideas.)",11
Monica," All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus,

umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music,

here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really

good with the food.",50
Phoebe," So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot,

co-host.",14
Monica," What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of

things for you to do!",15
Phoebe," Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? (Thinks of

something) All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!",30
Monica," Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant…",10
Monica," Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's (sadly) ""Audition didn't go so

well. (Happily) Yeah it did?""",17
Ross," (Pause) Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!",10
Joey," (also downtrodden) Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually

didn't get a callback.",17
Rachel," Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out

here and get some fresh air.",21
Rachel," Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? (He holds up his pack.) Y'know

what, actually… (She takes the one he's smoking and heads over to where Nancy and Kim

are standing and laughing.) Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?",44
Rachel," Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I

mean, like doobies? And I actually, I thought to myself, ""Wow, those guys are

crazy!"" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.",39
Ross," Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?",12
Ross," Yes!! I knew it!! (To the people who didn't make it.) Bye-bye! So long!

Later!",15
Joey, Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!,12
Ross," No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.",13
Chandler," Hey Ross, if Ben gets the commercial, 

do you think you can get me some free soup? ",17
Joey," Yeah, okay, but I have been supporting a 

29-year-old Italian for five years. ",13
Phoebe, Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?,13
Chandler," Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.",11
Phoebe," Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and

Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.",30
Chandler, Y'know I rued the day once…didn't get a whole lot else done.,12
Phoebe," Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. (She goes and opens the

door to Joey.) Oh, hi Joey!",21
Joey," Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.",14
Joey," Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me

going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I

think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.",43
Joey," That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career

we're talking about here!",16
Joey," I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone

should step aside it should be Ben!",22
Chandler," (shocked) Well I mean, let me get the door first. (Goes and opens the

door.) Oh, hi! No one. (Exits.)",20
Ross," Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you

just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.",23
Joey, Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn’t get it?,16
Joey," Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he

dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!",28
Ross, Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?,11
Rachel," Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said,

y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.",25
Rachel," Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking.

This is actually the smell of success.",19
Chandler, Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!,10
Rachel," All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!",15
Rachel," No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a

little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.",31
Rachel," I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I-I'm 

not myself. I-I-I smoked like half a pack. I feel a little shaky and a little 

weird. ",24
Chandler," Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!",15
Monica," Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smoky I have to get up. I'm

not kidding. (She's not; she stands and walks away. Chandler moves closer.)",28
Rachel, I am so on board! (She throws away her recently lit cigarette.),12
Rachel," Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back,

y'know? (Laughs) Good luck, Rach.",19
Rachel, Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!,11
Rachel," Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We

can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!",26
Rachel," Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it! (She grabs their

cigarettes and lighters and throws them in the trash.)",22
Rachel," Okay then! (She starts rummaging through the trash to find Kim's

lighter.)",12
Joey," Hmmm, soup! (Tries again.) Hmm soup! (Tries again, with a little

caveman thrown in.) Hmm, soup!",16
Joey," (goes over to Ben) Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya,

it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake

Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.

It's a tough life. I mean, sure, you can get up whenever 

you want, watch TV all day....meet tons of woman in acting class (smiles). 

(thinks about it) Oh, who am I kidding. I can't talk you out of this. It's a 

great life!",87
Joey," Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's

okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.",22
Joey, How's that different? (She looks at him until he gets it.) Oh! Yeah!,13
Joey," Hmm, soup. (Pause.) I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!",10
Joey," No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! (Eats another spoonful)

Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit! (Storms out.)",20
Rachel," So I think that if we get these samples 

into the magazine by Monday, we'll be fine. ",17
Rachel," Oh....well...kill... me now. Let me tell 

you something, I ate 40 Mallomars today. I mean, I have-I have patches all over 

my body, you know? I mean, I haven't slept in two days.",33
Rachel," (quickly thinks) That's counting today. 

(picking up a folder) But anyway, so these samples, I think, that, like I was 

saying....",21
Rachel," Umm, also Vogue called. And they 

were wondering if you were...",11
Rachel," Oh, umm, all right. (Kim leaves.) 

(looking through the papers) A...ahhh...(realizes something about Nancy and Kim)",16
Rachel, Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!,14
Rachel," Well, w-wait a minute. What-what about 

all we've talked about? You know, the disgusting place, the ugly people! (looks 

at some guy) Hey how you doing? (grabs his arm but he sarcastically nods and 

smiles)",35
Rachel," Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least

told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?",27
Phoebe," (To Chandler) Check it out! Cup hat! (Points to her hat.) Cup banner!

Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup! (Holds up one.)",27
Monica, (overhearing that) Why don't you just go out with her!,10
Phoebe," (following him) And did you notice the ice? (Gestures to 3 huge buckets

of ice on the table.) Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! (Pours

some water onto the dry ice, causing it to evaporate/smoke.) Ahhh! Mystical!",43
Monica," Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're

all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!",17
Chandler, There are snow cones?! (Monica glares at him.) Snow cones! Yuck!,11
Chandler, Thank you! Thank you! (Runs to the snow cone machine.),10
Monica," I deserve that. I just want you to know 

that, umm, if we ever cohost a party together again you can do whatever you 

want.",25
Phoebe," Umm, okay, I'd like to be in charge of 

beer. ",10
Monica," Well, then there's nothing left for me! 

(Phoebe motions ""Oh well."")",11
Rachel," Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean

Chandler's birthday is even before mine!",22
Rachel, Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.,13
Chandler," (puts down Rachel's purse as he is 

holding a carton of cigarettes from them) But just one, okay? Because nobody 

knows when my birthday is. ",25
Monica," Let me make this clear to you okay? It's 

either that (points to the cigarettes) or this (points to her.) ",20
Chandler," They were menthol. (They stop hugging 

and Monica hits him slightly on the shoulder.) ",14
Ross," Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.",11
Joey, Yeah right! (Gets up for a refill to his snow cone.),11
Joey," Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck.

I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, ""Hmm, noodle soup."" (Nods his head

in disgust.)",33
Ross," Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you

suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.",25
Ross," (pause) I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that

Ben would get the part.",18
Joey," Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. (Thinks about it.) Yeah.

Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor…",21
Joey," No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was

more important to see him succeed.",22
Chandler," (to Kim and Nancy) Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was

supposed to meet her for lunch.",21
Chandler," Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got

reservations at Ja George.",14
Chandler," Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more

interesting.",13
Chandler," Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came

first.",15
Ross," The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm,

let's say my sister?!",18
Ross," It was totally flirting. ""Somebody got a haircut (Makes some whiney,

nasally noises.)""",13
Chandler," Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not

flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.",24
Chandler," You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. (Starts to move

towards Ross.)",13
Rachel," I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law &

Order!",17
Phoebe, I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?,14
Rachel, No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.,12
Ross," Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting

on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.",30
Phoebe, Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.,10
Rachel," Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then.

I think it's okay that we see other people.",21
Ross," Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.",12
Ross, And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little…,12
Phoebe," (looking through the pizzas) Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay

Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!",26
Ross," This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when

she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.",29
Joey," (entering, with his grandmother) Hey everybody, look who's here! You

remember my grandmother!",13
Chandler," So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!",11
Chandler," I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. (She just

stares at him.) I've done it again.",18
Joey," No Nonnie, Nonnie's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's

believed in me. (To his grandmother in Italian.) Si Nonni, Iuo Numero Uno, 

no?  ",29
Joey," Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so…",12
Monica," So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in

London…",17
Monica, Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?,12
Monica, That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.,13
Chandler," Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?",10
Monica, That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.,11
Monica, (runs over to Phoebe) You have got to go home!,10
Monica," You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay?

Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.",21
Phoebe," Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get

dressed and I'll look for them.",20
Phoebe," Okay! (Walks over to Rachel) Rach, hi, I need those earrings you

borrowed.",13
Rachel," Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back. (Goes to her

room.)",15
Phoebe," I guess so. (See, the brief possession didn't affect her at all, like we

could really tell.)",17
Rachel, (She enters and hands Phoebe the earring) Here you go. Thank you!,12
Rachel," Oh what, you-you want both of them? 

That's a little greedy don't you think? ",14
Rachel," Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I

know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.",24
Phoebe," Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!",14
Rachel," Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow

her stuff!",14
Joey," Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.",14
Joey," Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.",12
Chandler," If you said, ""Big lima bean, bubbling up."" Would she

understand the difference?",13
Monica, (noticing Rachel crawling behind the couch) Rach? What are you doing?,11
Ross," I'll get it! I will get that! (Runs over.) 

(to everyone) Uh, how does my hair look? ",17
Ross," Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like

8-year-old boys.",18
Ross," (I can't make it out.) The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you

thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.",30
Chandler, Here you go. (Hands her the money.) Now stop bringing us pizzas you.,13
Ross, This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!,14
Chandler, Thank you for that! (To Monica) I was not flirting.,10
Monica," It's no big deal, I do it all the time.",10
Chandler," (starts to laugh, but then gets serious) So umm, you-you flirt with

guys all the time?",16
Monica," Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean

anything with you!",15
Chandler," Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than

I am.",15
Chandler," Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people.

Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other

women?",33
Rachel," Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.",12
Rachel," But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never

very good at the flirting thing.",19
Ross," What? (Mumbles) What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.",11
Rachel," Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn

nine years later you had me!",18
Ross," All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to

order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt.

Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! (To Chandler) And not the one on the menu!",48
Joey," Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! (They have two of the cops

on the street, then they cut to where they're entering an apartment.) Oh my God.",30
Joey," (smiling) Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if

she finds out.",14
Joey, (smiling) Not likely.  'Cause you see that body bag right there,11
Phoebe," (smiling) This is terrible, what are you going to do?",10
Joey," (smiling) I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When

they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.",25
Joey," (smiling) Yeah we had to get her a home 

nurse.",10
Joey," (smiling) Yeah, she almost died and got 

really expensive. You're not smiling. Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! (They all

smile.)",21
Rachel," (smiling) Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your

fault.",14
Chandler," (smiling) If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out

soon?",14
Joey," Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am! (Points to the screen, of

course it isn't him.)",19
Monica," (following her) Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to

leave as soon as the show is over.",20
Phoebe," All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said.

(Walks away over to Rachel.) Where is that other earring?",24
Rachel," It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's

last night! Okay! (Goes to the door.)",21
Phoebe," Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!",15
Ross," (To Phoebe) Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for

ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?",24
Phoebe, (she just looks at him) Why are you being weird?,10
Chandler," So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?",12
Chandler," See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the

Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!",28
Monica," Chandler! (Joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, which

they do.) Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.",30
Chandler," Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are

different for men and for women.",20
Chandler," Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when

you flirt with a guy you think, ""I'm just flirting, no big deal."" But the guy is

thinking, ""Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!""",38
Chandler," All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys

from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.",30
Joey," (To Ross in the kitchen) All right, it's another commercial; I still

haven't told her!",15
Ross," Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like (checks his watch)

ten minutes left!",16
Joey," I know, I know! What am I going to do? (Thinks) Ooh!",12
Monica, No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!,11
Joey," (dejected) Yeah, all right. (Thinks of something.) Ooh! (He quickly runs

out before anyone can stop him.)",17
Chandler," Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! (Tries to pantomime it

for her.) Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. (Pause.) So, you're old and small.",26
Rachel," The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've

been looking for these since like last summer. (Puts 'em on.)",24
Phoebe," Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.",10
Rachel," Okay, calm down, here they are. (Gives back the sunglasses.)",10
Monica," (entering from her room) Phoebe! (Motions for the earrings. Phoebe gives

her the one-minute sign.)",15
Phoebe," All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.",12
Phoebe, I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.,11
Phoebe," Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!",14
Monica," (shocked) Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it

you lost it.",18
Phoebe," I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.",10
Monica," All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.",11
Rachel," Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen

honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it.

I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too. (Holds out her arms for a hug.)",44
Monica," (angrily) That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! (Rachel

looks over at Phoebe in resignation.) Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's

not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!",44
Ross," (running to the door) Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! (to everyone) Okay, here goes.

Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.",20
Chandler," Okay, hold on. (Pauses as he readies himself.) Okay. (Walks away.)",11
Rachel," Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I

don't flirting is the right thing to… (Ross interrupts and shushes her.)",26
Ross," (He opens the door while faking a laugh.) Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating

like this. (Monica turns her head in shame.)",22
Ross," Okay, (gets the money) so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh,

wood-burning ovens?",17
Chandler," (To Monica) If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a

problem.",16
Ross," The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a

leak.",16
Ross," Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will

be right there. (Goes and sits on the couch dejectedly.)",25
Rachel," Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes. (She grabs a couple

of the old pizza boxes and exits.)",21
Rachel," Hey! Hey! (Stops Caitlin) Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs?

The ones with all the pizza?",16
Rachel," No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually

umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.",24
Rachel," I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past

that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.",31
Rachel," Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really 

funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. ",19
Rachel," See, there-there you go. And 

besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.",14
Rachel," Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?",14
Rachel," Hmm. Well you know at some point, uh, 

you and I may need to have a longer conversation. ",18
Rachel," (entering) Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and

uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.",26
Rachel," Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.

(Hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)",27
Ross," Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.",12
Joey," (says hi to his grandma) Look! Oh! (Pointing out the window.) Is that the

Pope?! (Chandler and his grandma turn to look and Joey slips a tape into the VCR.)",30
Joey, (on the tape) All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!,16
Joey," (on the tape) Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. (The

duck quacks, to the duck) Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! (To the imaginary cops) Filled with $100,000

in small bills, and if I don't get it…(the duck quacks louder) Shoo!! And if I don't

get it, (pause, picks up the duck) I'm gonna shoot this duck!",57
Joey," (on the tape) I'm comin' out! (He opens the door and hops out pointing the

gun in all directions and then runs out of view.)",25
Joey," (to his grandmother) That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!",12
Chandler, You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.,10
Chandler," (looking at them) They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best

taste or what?",15
Monica," Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily

gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.",29
Ross," (sits down at the table) Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married

tomorrow. (Joey panics.) ",16
Joey, (to the rest of the gang) Somebody help me out here!,11
Phoebe," Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he

let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.",30
Chandler, Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.,11
Monica," Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally

organize these photos!",16
Monica," Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got

holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know… And then what I've done is I've

cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays

and dogs, you get Photo 152. See? (Hands her the photo.)",49
Rachel," Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.",11
Monica," You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.",10
Monica," All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.",14
Rachel," Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?",11
Rachel," Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix

you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?",19
Rachel," No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you

get all the margarita stuff ready.",20
Monica," All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some

cash.",15
Monica," Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around…",11
Ross," (to Gary) That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.",14
Ross, (to Gary) He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!,12
Ross," Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?",11
Joey," (returning from a deli) Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich

in the world!",17
Joey," (dejected) Yeah okay. (To Chandler) Even though my tax dollars paid for

this car.",14
Chandler," (leans in and takes a sniff of Joey's sandwich) Wow! That sandwich

really does smell good.",16
Joey, Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!,13
Chandler," Okay, I'll give them back. (Exhales strongly through his nose and Joey

just glares at him.) Look! What is so great about that sandwich?",24
Rachel," Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please!

Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! (She picks up the 2 pieces and looks at the

stand.) Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?! (Looks for a place to hide it and

finds a wall sconce and drops the pieces into it and heads into the kitchen as the phone

rings.)",63
Monica," I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt,

some margarita mix, and tequila.",20
Chandler," Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?",12
Joey," Come on man! (To Gary) Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perp's shoes

a little bit before he lawyers up?",22
Ross," Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!",10
Chandler," Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.",13
Ross," Umm, jealous! (He drops the cherry and it turns on.)",10
Ross," Sorry! Sorry! Oh, (He sticks it under his shirt) there! (It's just there

flashing through his shirt) Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!",24
Chandler, Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.,10
Monica," Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!",13
Monica," We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back

and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling,

neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?",42
Rachel," Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know

that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right

to erase his message!",36
Monica," I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come

on! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him—help him?",27
Monica," No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about

running out on her wedding day. (Rachel slowly turns and glares at her.) (Realizing what

she just said.) Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's

he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I

mean, who would do that?! (Rachel again turns and glares at her in disgust.) Okay, fine,

all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same

people.",95
Monica," Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to

play on him.",16
Rachel," Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset!

I mean, listen! (She hits a button on the machine.)",21
Chandler," Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!",12
Monica, Oh yeah right! (She grabs the money and shoves into her pocket.),12
Rachel," Yeah, but maybe I could call his machine 

and re-create the message.  All right, okay..umm..(impersonating Emily with 

the British accent) Hello, Ross, this is Rachel--Emily. (stops) God, what is it 

with those two names? (impersonating again) Umm, I just do so wanted to say that 

I'm going to be getting married ...to..another..British person. And I'm-m-m 

having doubts and...scones and... (stops) I can't remember what she said.",66
Monica," Yeah, that's the problem with this plan. 

Rachel, come on. You know what, the message is erased. There's nothing we can 

do. He's never going to find out about it.",30
Monica," Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with

you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of

it.",34
Rachel," Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.",12
Ross," (on the machine) Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this

feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay?

Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye! (He hangs up.)",40
Monica, Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!,12
Ross," Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the

car…",13
Ross," Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired.

And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!",27
Ross, And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.,10
Chandler," Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think

I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (He gets up

and starts for the door.)",35
Phoebe," Ross, I could have told you, you weren't 

gonna die today. ",11
Ross," What? You know when I'm gonna die?  

(Phoebe pantomimes that she is keeping her mouth locked and throwing the key 

away.)",21
Phoebe," Yeah! Sure! Yep! (Gets up) Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now,

I'd throw my body on you.",21
Joey," Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the

same day!",20
Chandler," Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever…",12
Joey," That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!",11
Joey," Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want

Ross out of the picture.",22
Joey," I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!",10
Chandler," Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but

y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!",28
Joey," Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No!

I…knew…you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's

not street like us!",30
Chandler," When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you

would for me. That's the bottom line.",22
Joey," Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross.

Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.",32
Joey," Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!",11
Joey," I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is (Goes and picks up the

sandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world!",21
Joey, No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!,10
Joey," Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, (He unwraps the sandwich

and holds it out for Chandler) here.",22
Chandler, I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.,12
Rachel," Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay?

This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!",23
Ross," Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here.

You're my friend, and you're here. Oh! (He goes over and hugs her.)",24
Ross," The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had

an actual near death experience!",19
Ross," Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right? ",11
Ross," No, a car backfired, but (Rachel suddenly calms down) I thought somebody

was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I…I survived! And I was filled with this-this

great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every

opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.",52
Rachel," Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole ""seizing""

thing but um, Emily called you today.",18
Rachel," No, she left a message. (He starts for the machine.) (Stopping him.) But

it-it kinda got erased. There's just (Pause) something wrong with your machine.",25
Rachel," Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and

did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.",27
Rachel," Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?",11
Rachel," Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because—I'm sorry, all right. 

I'm gonna go tell Monica I was right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me—not important. The point is, I was right. Your

decision. Okay? I was right. (She starts for the door.) (Stops) Your decision.",45
Rachel," Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right,

no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really

want to get back into that?",34
Ross," Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my

ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to

mean something!",32
Rachel," Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely

an experience!",14
Ross," You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to

seize! Y'know?",14
Rachel," Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is

about escaping stuff.",16
Rachel," I mean, look-look today you escaped (Pause) (Not believing it) death,

y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with

Emily?",27
Ross," That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I

really don't wanna see or talk to her.",21
Ross, Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it. ,11
Ross," (on machine) ""Hey Ross, it's you!"" (Hits the stop button) Oh

yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.",22
Ross," (looking at the coffee table where his money was) Hey umm, was-was Monica

here?",14
Rachel," (going out the door) Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps,

right?",13
Ross," Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?",10
Phoebe," Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a

good story.",17
Ross," I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but

heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.",23
Monica," Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a

fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you

guys.",35
Chandler, Before or after you were shot by your own troops?,10
Ross," I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all

of us.",17
Phoebe," Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in

any way. (Gets up) But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you

all. (Starts to leave.) (To Joey) Not you Joey.",41
Chandler," (To Monica) Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?",11
Monica," No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get

some tea.",15
Monica," So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?",12
Monica, I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?,12
Monica," I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers.

Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral…",37
Monica, (sitting down) Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!,11
Monica," He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I

couldn't hold it in any longer!",22
Chandler," (terrified) Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's

fast!",11
Chandler," Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! (Breathes a sigh of relief)",13
Phoebe," No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!",14
Phoebe, I don't know. I'll just handle it—I'll ask you to talk to him!,13
Phoebe," Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him

scared like you! Make him a…man!",19
Chandler," I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm

a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.",25
Monica," That is so sweet! (She kisses him and turns to add some sugar to her

tea.)",16
Chandler," (To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll take care of

it. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away he

nods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)",35
Joey," Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?",10
Ross," (he catches the ball and pauses, staring at Joey in disbelief) Also an

island.",14
Joey," Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it,

for like an hour?",16
Joey," Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say

anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.",22
Ross, Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!,13
Joey," Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checks his

pants.) Yeah, my pants are a little loose!",23
Rachel," All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna

like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I

was a little girl.",35
Rachel," Okay! (She goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, Ross

stares in shock.) Check it out!",20
Joey," That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}",14
Rachel," Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!",10
Rachel," Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.",12
Ross," For a thousand dollars, you'd think at 

least it'd come with hair. ",12
Rachel," All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a

little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap

and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!",54
Rachel," Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care

what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. (They both

glare at her.) Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!",41
Ross," (To Joey) Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how

long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?",26
Joey," Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without

dropping it?!",16
Ross," I know! (Looks at the ball in his hands.) Don't switch hands, okay?",13
Chandler, Hey ladies! What are you in here for? (Laughs at his joke.),12
Chandler, It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.,13
Chandler," Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with

you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.",27
Chandler," Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two

are gonna be y'know, live-living together!",20
Chandler," I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived

with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to

bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!",42
Chandler," Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.",11
Chandler," Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in

with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!",25
Ross," …now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they

discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws!

How did it get there?!",30
Monica," Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. (Goes to the counter)

It was right here, where is it?",21
Monica," Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and

just help me find it!",18
Monica," (on phone, faking she's sick) I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into

work today, I don't feel very good. (Joey makes a high throw and Monica has to catch it

way over her head.) (Not sounding sick) Yes!! (Realizes what she just did.) (Sounding sick

again) Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. (Hangs up

and keeps throwing the ball.)",70
Monica," You have scratches all over you, what happened? (Rachel's arms are

covered with scratches.)",14
Rachel," You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean,

it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it

just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy,

but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, ""Rachel!""",60
Ross, Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.,12
Monica," (To Rachel) What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me

300!!",16
Phoebe," Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?",11
Chandler," Yes I did, and I think you should do it.",10
Chandler," He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky

lady.",17
Phoebe," You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing

you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!",25
Chandler," I’m sorry. (Pause) If you ask me, I'd move in with him.",12
Phoebe," Ohh!! God! (Gary enters and she sees him) Ooh! (To Chandler) Get out of

here, good for nothing.",18
Phoebe," No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying

still. And staying still is good. Watch this. (She stays still for a brief second.) ",27
Phoebe," That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean

there's so much we don't know about each other.",24
Phoebe, I just—I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.,13
Phoebe," I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just—I'm worried

it's gonna be a big mistake.",19
Ross," (catching the ball) Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same

team!",14
Chandler, Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?,11
Chandler," All right, let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in the

game.)",16
Monica, (jumping in front of him) No-no! Don't do it! Don't!,10
Ross, All right. (He gently tosses the ball to Chandler who catches it.),12
Chandler," Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball, but loses control

and almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)",22
Rachel," (she's wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand) I give up you guys, I

don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!",25
Monica," So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?",13
Rachel," Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean,

what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?",25
Joey," Look, you said it was a show cat. Why 

don't you show it, win some prize money? ",17
Rachel," No, those shows cost like a hundred 

bucks to enter and all you win are these ribbons which technically belong to the 

damn cat! ",24
Monica," Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what

to do with it.",20
Rachel," No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all

scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! (Storms out.)",29
Monica," Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My

vision's been compromised!! (Quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.) Oh God! Okay. Okay.

It's okay. Man, that was close.",36
Phoebe," Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most

excited!",14
Phoebe," Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!",12
Phoebe," I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do

really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the

money I'll save on stamps.",38
Phoebe," No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of

stamps. Don't they?",16
Phoebe," Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.",10
Phoebe," No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't

have a pool, I need a pool. (Turns away from him.)",25
Phoebe," (sits down) Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.",11
Phoebe," Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. (Pause) Can I get some water?",11
Phoebe," (looks at the paper) Are these for rent! I thought people were just

bragging!",14
Phoebe," Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have

doubts! (Pause) I'm sorry! (Puts her head down.)",22
Phoebe," No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!",13
Phoebe," Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!

(Hugs him.) ",15
Phoebe," Oh wait, one sec. One sec. (Goes to the mirror) Hey you! Behind the

glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these

rooms, (sees the look on his face) which was never!",43
Rachel, Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! (A woman approaches.),10
Rachel," Oh no! No! It's actually—it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look!

(Goes to pet it and it hisses at her.) Yeah, do you want it?",25
Rachel," Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All

right? Move on!",19
Rachel," Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more

of an investment than a cat.",21
Rachel," (makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) Obviously you

know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call

the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! (Covers her eyes) Just take cat, leave

the money, and run away! Run away! (Uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled)

Damnit! (To the cat) Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! (The cat hisses at her

again, it sounds like Rachel) Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?",92
Monica," Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check

time!",15
Joey," I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We (Ross and him) invented

this game!",17
Monica," All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand

right? Are you with me?",20
Monica," All right! Let's go! (Runs to the door.) Let's go Team Monica! (The guys

all stop and stare at her) All right, we can work out the name later.",29
Monica, Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!,11
Rachel," It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. (Pause) Oh, I uh sold Mrs.

Whiskerson.",13
Rachel," Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind. (Turns and walks away.)",12
Phoebe," I like waking up with you too. (Looks out the window) Oh! It's such a

beautiful morning. (Some birds are singing outside the window) Oh, I can stay here all

day.",31
Phoebe, Okay. (He grabs his gun and shoots the bird.) Oh! Oh no.,12
Monica," All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!",11
Ross," (wakes up shockingly and catches the ball) 

Oh, I was having the best dream. ",14
Ross," I dreamed I was drowning and (angrily) not 

throwing this ball. (He throws it with anger to Monica who gives him a look.)

",23
Rachel, Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?,12
Chandler," Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can

work it out!",16
Phoebe," (catches it) Nah, I don't feel like playing. (She sets the ball down on

the table and everyone gasps.)",19
Monica," It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one

needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official

ballplayers can drop the ball!",32
Monica," Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha! (Runs out the door

and everyone watches her leave.)",18
Joey," Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball

around?",15
Rachel," No, I meant with the dropper over here. (Points at Chandler.)",11
Chandler," Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything

but a dropper. (We see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, the

phone, an apple, a Frisbee, a record, and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his

chest. I'm not going to describe them, you'll have to see them.)",60
Monica, (To Rachel) Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.,13
Chandler," Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!",10
Monica," Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!",12
Monica, It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.,12
Rachel," Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!",10
Ross," Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like

freaks out. Watch! Watch! (He takes his finger and moves it towards his eye.)",27
Rachel," (flinches) Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird

thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?",23
Monica," Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I? (And on

the ""I"" part she mimics poking her eye.)",20
Ross," Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I? (Pokes

his eye)",17
Chandler," How much did I love The King and I? (Oh, you get the

point by now.)",16
Joey," Me too! Me too! Me too! (Yeah, he does the same thing.) ",12
Ross," All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park.",11
Phoebe," (after he's gone) I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I

didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!",28
Phoebe," I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!",10
Phoebe," You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by

the way?",17
Phoebe," Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, ""Ross"" on it.",12
Joey," (entering, depressed) Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess

what. (Pause, then very excitedly) I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!",25
Chandler, You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!,13
Joey," It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl

in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she

disappears… But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady

answers the door and I say, ""Where's Betsy?"" Right? And she says, ""Betsy's

been dead for 10 years.""",64
Joey," And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! (To

Chandler) And you know what that means buddy!",21
Joey," Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!",16
Phoebe," No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las

Vegas.",17
Chandler," Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?",10
Chandler," All right, great, road trip baby! (To Monica) This okay with you?",12
Monica, Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. (Quietly) You can go.,13
Monica," Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!",13
Rachel," (entering from her bedroom) All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh!

(She walks by the table and notices that no one is looking and accidentally on purpose

knocks over the open cereal box.) Ohhh! No! Look what I did! (She starts walking through

the mess. {Also, notice the continuity error in this scene. Note the position of the box

and dispersal pattern of the cereal before and after the camera cut.}) Oh, I mean, look at

this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to

reschedule!",95
Monica," No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All

right, let's go Blinky! (She ushers Rachel out the door, but before the door fully closes

she sticks her head back in.) Chandler!!!! (Chandler agrees to clean up the mess.)",45
Joey," I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot

right?",15
Joey," Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern

route?",14
Phoebe," Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois 

with a beard of bees. ",17
Phoebe, But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.,11
Phoebe," Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a

series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.",28
Phoebe," Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax.

Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. (Quickly) Which do you like better peanut butter or

egg whites?",33
Phoebe, Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?,10
Joey," Monica. Oh… huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.",10
Joey," Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!",10
Ross," Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?",11
Joey," Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!",12
Phoebe," Umm, no thank you. (She gets up and moves to the couch. They were at a

table previously.)",18
Joey," I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you

questions and you answer real quick. Okay?",22
Joey," Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.",11
Monica, (looks at it more closely) Oh that's an eye removal machine.,11
Rachel," I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. (Puts her head

back.) Okay.",16
Rachel," (really excited) Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow!

Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! (He took out that thing they use to look at

people's retinas and looked at Rachel's when she was shaking his hand causing her to

flinch and scream at him.)",50
Rachel," Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.",10
Rachel," Okay, just give me the damn drops! (Grabs them and storms out.)",12
Monica," Dr. Miller? (She covers her right eye and reads from the chart) P E C F

D.",17
Monica," I sure do! (She runs over to a drawer, opens it, and grabs a lollipop.)

(To Rachel) And you don't get one!",22
Rachel," Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a

100% better.",17
Chandler," Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or

will all these sweater vests be enough? (Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)",31
Joey," Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!",13
Phoebe, Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!,12
Chandler," Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big

hotel suite?",17
Joey," Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a

real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.",25
Chandler," I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big

hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?",30
Joey," Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right

in Joey's pocket.",17
Chandler, So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?,10
Joey," Did you not hear the plot of the movie? ""She's been dead for ten

years."" I'm gonna be a millionaire!",20
Ross," I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will

place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.",27
Joey, Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?,10
Rachel," Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the

puss.",16
Rachel," Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! (Runs

after him.)",15
Ross," Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? (Phoebe ignores him) Pheebs? (Turns away)

Hello? (He sits down next to her and she moves over a bit.) Phoebe? (He moves closer and

she keeps moving away.) Phoe-Phoebe! (They end up hanging over the arm rest.) Come on! (He

grabs the magazine away from her.)",51
Ross," Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please,

tell me what it is I did!",21
Ross," All right. (Gets up.) I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?",11
Ross," ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did

that mad you so mad at me!",23
Ross," What?! What do you mean-what do you mean 

you can't remember?! ",11
Phoebe," I was so focused on being mad at you 

that I forgot what it was I was mad about!",19
Ross," Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?",11
Phoebe," Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat

ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little heinie. ",28
Joey," Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.",12
Chandler," We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road

once.",14
Joey," Don't worry, it's out there! (Just then a horn honks and Joey quickly

looks at the road.) I think I just need lunch.",23
Joey," Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a

bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind

Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!",41
Chandler," Okay! Okay, so it's all clear except 

for this image of a small, purple lamp. (pause) Is that all right if that stays 

in there?",25
Joey," (thinks about it) Yeah. I don't see why 

not. I guess. All right now you have to answer with the first thing that pops 

into your head okay? ",28
Joey," Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?",11
Joey, You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?,13
Chandler," Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.",15
Joey, What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!,11
Chandler, They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!,13
Joey," Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all

over my big break.",18
Chandler," Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.",12
Joey," Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if

it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.",25
Chandler," All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like

that I'll lie.",18
Chandler," All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right

now!",14
Joey," Fine! (He slams on the brakes, stopping the car on the bridge to the sound

of numerous car horns.) Get out!",21
Chandler," All right!! (Gets out and Joey speeds away.) Wait! Wait, there's no

sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.",18
Ross," Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?",11
Ross, Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?,12
Monica," Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar?

Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!",17
Rachel," Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he

starts to lose.",20
Chandler, Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!,12
Chandler," I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where

you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.",23
Chandler," Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that

uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do

anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he

should've pushed me off of the bridge.",55
Chandler," Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts

that I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear with

one leg?",38
Rachel," Okay. (She tilts her head back and squeezes the eyedropper. The only

problem is, it's not over her eye.)",19
Rachel," Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!",13
Monica, How many fingers am I holding up? (She's not holding any up.),12
Monica," Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run?

Okay?",14
Monica," On three, 1…2…3! (Rachel turns her head on three to avoid the

drops.) Now my pillow's all wet! (She was trying to fool Rachel and squeezed the

eyedropper.)",28
Monica," All right, come here! (She gets up and drags Rachel off of the couch by

her legs.)",17
Rachel," (as she's being dragged) What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God!

Stop it! (Monica drags her totally onto the floor and on her back.)",26
Monica," I am going… I'm going--Turn it over! (Rachel rolled onto her

stomach and Monica rolls her back.) I'm… I am going to get these drops in your eyes.

(She is holding Rachel down with both hands and has the eyedropper in her mouth.) ",43
Rachel," Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a

fortune! (Monica is straddling Rachel and holding her arms down. In a rather risqué pose,

at least for primetime TV.)",34
Phoebe," Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. (Thinks) Or-or Rachel!",11
Monica," (answers the phone) Hello? (Listens.) (To Phoebe) It's Joey. (Phoebe's

proud of herself.) (To Joey) I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened.

Y'know he's really upset about it.",31
Joey," (on a pay phone holding a box) Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds

out what I did with his sweater vests!",25
Joey," Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica

listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.",25
Monica," Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second. (She hands the phone to Phoebe.)",13
Joey," Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat.

What-what is it?",16
Phoebe," Oh that's my grandma. (Joey holds the box away from him.) And thanks

Joey she's having a really great time. (Joey is happy now.)",24
Chandler," (who has just entered) Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him!

I wanna talk to him!",20
Phoebe," Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering… (We hear the dial

tone as Joey hangs up.) Okay, I guess he ran out of change.",24
Chandler," Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him

if he won't even talk to me?",22
Monica," Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las

Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.",20
Chandler," That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket of

porn…",15
Phoebe," Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that

why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.",22
Ross," (entering) Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay,

clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?",27
Phoebe," Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!",10
Phoebe," Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing

chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron

Diaz! (Realizes) Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.",44
Ross," (frustrated) So this entire time, you've 

been angry with me because of a dream?!  Well, guess what, Phoebe? Now I'm 

mad at you! (Phoebe pinches Ross.) Oww!",27
Phoebe,"  I-I wanted to make sure that this 

wasn't a dream. Otherwise we're wasting each other's time. ",16
Joey, Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.,12
Joey," Thanks. (The grip walks away.) (Reading the card.) Congratulations on your

big break. ",13
Monica," Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!",11
Joey," Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!",10
Monica," Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room?

Do you have a chair with your name on it?",25
Joey," Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want

you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta

go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here! ",39
Joey," Everybody smile! (The picture is taken) Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your

stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! (The family leaves.) Kill me. Kill me

now.",27
Monica," Okay! Okay! Okay! (She succeeds in getting the eye drops in and everyone

climbs off of Rachel.) We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.",26
Rachel, Oh! (She's trying to recover while still on the floor.),10
Phoebe, Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie? ,12
Rachel," No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I

want to talk to are right here.",21
Joey," Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to

my ATM card can, can you get it for me?",26
Joey," Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.",12
Phoebe," (to Joey) Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?",10
Chandler, (To Phoebe) Is that Joey?! (She nods yes) Let me talk to him!,13
Joey," No! (She nods no to Chandler) Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which

is a big mistake because it is real! Real!",23
Joey," Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar

for my tastes.",16
Chandler," (To Phoebe) Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all

week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in

person.",35
Joey," Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?",10
Chandler," No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to

prove that to you in person!",17
Joey, I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!,10
Chandler, Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!,11
Joey," Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!",12
Joey," Uh, Entertainment Tonight. [Cut to Chandler] Yeah, okay so, good

talking to ya and don't come out here. All right. (Hangs up the phone and poses for that

picture.)",29
Phoebe," Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! (Starts looking around for her) Monica?

(Goes into Monica's bedroom.)",15
Monica," (entering) Phoebe? (Phoebe comes back into the living room) Oh, Phoebe,

I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?",19
Phoebe, (saddened) It's okay. What the hell took you so long?,10
Monica," Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.",12
Phoebe," Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?",11
Monica," It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having

lunch with him.",17
Phoebe, That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.,14
Monica," The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I

didn't feel anything at all!",20
Monica," Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I

just don't want anything to spoil that.",19
Phoebe," Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!",10
Chandler," I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your

annoying friend Chandler.",17
Monica," I know, but you have to open it today! (Hands it too him.)",13
Monica," (grabbing the gift from him and opening it) Okay! There you go! It's two

tickets to Vegas!",17
Monica," For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus

we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out

plane-aversary.",31
Chandler," Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.",15
Monica," Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how

excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own,

ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!",33
Phoebe," Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.",13
Phoebe," Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to

surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!",21
Rachel," Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.",11
Phoebe," Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes

me!",15
Rachel," Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't

miss that.",15
Ross," Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a

year for this.",18
Ross," So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.",11
Ross, Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. (Picks up the phone and does so),14
Rachel," Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself

for a night.",16
Rachel, No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.,13
Rachel," No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around

naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.",23
Phoebe, Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?,14
Phoebe," So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to

London?",16
Phoebe," Okay, what about after I give you these candies? (Hands them each one

from her purse.)",16
Phoebe," Ah-ha! Okay, (takes out a notepad) Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right

back. (Gets up and heads aft.)",20
Chandler," Okay! (He grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it.) Oh man!

Don’t tell me I did this!",18
Chandler," How do you feel about the, ""I really did forgot the present,

please forgive me"" not fake out?",18
Monica," Oh that's okay. Don’t worry about it, you can give it to me when we

get back.",17
Chandler," Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary

ever!",12
Phoebe," (sitting down) Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the

Richard thing.",16
Monica," Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to

go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad

and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.",45
Chandler, (talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad.,11
Chandler," Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite!

It's no big deal. (He still ain't happy.)",20
Rachel," (takes off her robe) Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up

guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I

wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} (In her

head.) Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen…naked! I'm picking up an orange. (Does

so) I'm naked! (Goes into the living room) Lighting the candles, naked, and

carefully. (She backs anything that might have a point like a candle on her body

away.)",92
Ross," (in his head) Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I

am looking at this. (Looks back at his book.) Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush

strokes—Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She

knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely

tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?",72
Rachel," (singing) Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow!

(There's a knock on the door, she turns off the music, puts on her robe, and goes to

answer the door.) Love to love ya, baby! (There's another knock.) Darnit! (Looks

through the peephole and turns on the lights.) Ugh. (She opens the door to Ross who's

leaning against the door jam.) ",65
Ross," So do I. (Slowly walks in.) Okay Rach, before anything happens (He takes

off his coat) I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. (Turns back to face her.)

This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the

question of ""Us."" (Rachel's confused) Okay? I just want this to be (Kicks off

his left shoe) about what it is! (Kicks off the other one.)",76
Ross," Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your

nakedness?",13
Rachel," Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with

you?!",14
Ross," No! No! (Grabs his coat) No! (Grabs a shoe.) No-no-no-no. (Grabs the other

one and heads for the door.)",19
Rachel," Ohh wow! I’m sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!",11
Ross," All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack. (Starts to leave)",11
Rachel," Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the

question of ""us?""",18
Phoebe," Hey you guys wait! Guys! (Catches up to them.) This place is so much

better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak

and lobster dinner. Huh!",34
Phoebe," For 99 cents, I'd eat you. (Sees the casino) Okay, I can totally settle

down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! (Points to Joey in

his gladiator suit posing for a picture with two old ladies.) Oh! Look! Hi!",44
Phoebe," Hey! Joey! (They all head over to him, he spots them coming and panics.)

Hey! Hey!! Wow! (She hugs him.)",20
Joey, What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.,14
Joey," Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a

gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. (To no one in particular) Can we cut?

Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.",41
Joey," They uh director. Uhh, her. (Points to an old woman standing behind him.

Who glares at him and walks off.) All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work

here.",32
Joey," Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working

here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.",24
Joey," Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. (To Chandler) I'm sorry man.",12
Chandler," No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't

have to share everything with everybody.",17
Monica," It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not

trust me?",14
Chandler," When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about

it!",14
Monica," I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.",10
Chandler, There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!,14
Monica," I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!",14
Monica," Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really,

I don't even want to be around you.",22
Joey," Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big

misunderstanding.",15
Joey, Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here! (Walks away.),11
Rachel," (taking off her sweater) Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm

going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not

an invitation to the physical act of love.",37
Rachel," No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.",12
Ross, Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.,12
Rachel," Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that

easily.",13
Rachel," No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.",15
Ross," (loudly so that everyone can hear) Hey lady! I don't care how much you

want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom! (Rachel

sinks lower on her chair trying to hide.)",38
Joey," Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.",12
Joey," Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They

would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get

dirty so they would stick it right…",38
Chandler," (interrupting in the nick of time) Joey, I uh! I can't believe

this is how I'm spending my anniversary.",19
Joey," All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a

hundred bucks today.",18
Joey," Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000.

Can you believe that? $5,000!",18
Chandler," Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body

and hit Richard from behind with a stick! (Mimics it.)",25
Joey," Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and

turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie

going again!",34
Joey, Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!,10
Monica, I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!,11
Phoebe," Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with

Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. (Monica turns and stares at her.) I am so

sorry.",27
Monica," This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna

see Richard again.",17
Phoebe," So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him

that you're sorry and that you love him.",23
Monica," Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you! (Gets up to

find Chandler.)",14
Phoebe," Sure! (When Monica gets close to the door.) (Yelling) Yeah! Las Vegas,

number one!",14
Monica," Anybody lose this? (Holds up the chip and the woman next to her shakes

her head no.)",17
Rachel," Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?",10
Rachel," Ross! What are you… I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really

likes you.",16
Ross," (to the guy in the window seat next to him) Hey! Y'know that teacher who

had a baby with her student? (He points at Rachel.)",25
Rachel," (to the flight attendant who appears in record time. It was only seconds

after Rachel pushed the call button was she there. Once again, more proof that TV isn't

real, IRL she would've been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then Ross's pants

would be dry.) Hi! ",50
Rachel," Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to

have had a little accident.",19
Joey, (to the dealer) Can I change a hundred? (He hands him his chip.),13
Joey," Hit me! (He does so.) Ohh man! (Joey busts and loses all the money, but

when the dealer starts to collect the cards Joey notices something.) Wait! (He holds his

hand next to the dealer's hand.)",36
Joey," Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical

hand twin!",14
Joey," What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was

incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like mine! It-it was like looking at

my hands in a mirror!",32
Chandler, Are you sure you weren't (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?,13
Joey," Don’t you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie.

I'm gonna be a millionaire!",18
Joey," Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money!

Come on! Identical hands!",19
Joey," This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much

would you pay to see this hand (Holds up his left hand) twice? Huh?",28
Chandler," (Pause) Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.",11
Chandler," No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away.

Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!",27
Joey," Right? I know. Okay. All right. (grabs a 

disposable camera) ",10
Joey," Well, I gotta document this before that 

dealer gets off his break. ",12
Phoebe," Ohh, you are so lucky! (To Chandler) Hey! So, where's Monica? Did

you guys make up?",16
Phoebe," Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she

came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!",31
Phoebe," Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta

find her.",15
Phoebe," Good. (After he leaves, she puts on Joey's gladiator helmet and checks

herself out in the mirror) I should really start wearing hats!",23
Rachel," Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent. (Disembarks)",11
Rachel," Hello! (She makes a face and the kid laughs harder. Finally, his parents

drag him off.) Ohh, kids love me.",20
Phoebe," (sees Rachel's face) What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess

umm Pancho Vila? (Points at Rachel) and you're Bob Saget. (An old lady has sat down at the

slot machine Phoebe was just at.)",38
Phoebe," Yeah! (Motions to her face, indicating all of Rachel's

""make-up."")",10
Rachel," What are you talking about Pheebs? (Takes out her compact) I don't…

(She gasps when she looks in the mirror and sees her face.) (To Ross) Oh my God, you drew

on me?!",33
Rachel," Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I

can—you have so crossed a line. (Heads for the bathroom)",22
Ross," Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way. (Points in the other direction.

Rachel hits him with her purse and heads for the ladies room.)",25
Phoebe, That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.,14
Ross," Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits

for you to give up and then…",21
Ross," My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance—karate

lessons.",15
Ross," Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport. (Does a karate chop, then does a

little dance-type sway.)",17
Rachel," (returning with her purse covering her face) All right, it won't

come off!",13
Rachel," No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.",12
Ross," Rach, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sure we 

can get it off, okay? ",14
Ross," (starts looking for it) What? Why? What 

are you gonna do with it?",13
Joey," Who's your friend? He's hot! (Ross laughs and Rachel smacks him with her

purse.)",14
Ross," Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.",11
Joey," No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand

twin!",15
Joey," My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like 

mine!",12
Joey," Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live

with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the

thumb.",34
Monica," All right baby, come on! (Rolls the dice) Yes! Yes! I am on fire!",14
Monica," What? Wait! Why? (He turns and heads for the door and she chases after

him.) Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I’m sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was

trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I

won't! He means nothing to me!",54
Chandler," Come on! I was there! (He's propped up with his hand on a statute of a

naked guy. He winces and pulls his hand away.) I know he's the love of your life.",33
Monica," Really! (They hug and kiss) All right? Let's forget about this going

home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. (She picks up his suitcase.) Okay, this is

empty.",27
Chandler," Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.",12
Joey," He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. (Holds up his

hand.) See?",15
Ross," (on the phone) Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw

on my friend's face. (Listens) A beard and a moustache. (Listens and laughs) Thank you.

(Rachel turns around and glares at him.) No, she didn't think so. (Listens) I know

it's like (turns and sees Rachel staring at him and quickly changes the subject) anyway,

umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's

worked. What-what do we do? (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Yeah. (Listens)

Oh! Okay. (Listens) Okay, thank you! (Rachel gets excited at his tone.) (Hangs up the

phone) Yeah, it's not coming off.",110
Ross," Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So…(Rachel stares at him.) Okay,

look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all

about it.",30
Rachel," Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like

this!",14
Ross," Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't

have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you.

Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! (Rachel turns around and

glares at him.) There are tons…of…freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one

will notice, I swear!",62
Rachel," Okay, I need a, I need a drink! (Makes a beeline for the mini-bar.)",14
Ross," Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. (Rachel

glares at him.) But who cares?! Because it's all on me! (Rachel reaches into the fridge

and pulls out two handfuls of those mini booze bottles.) (Watching her.) That is, one big

drink! ",44
Rachel," (she's finished reliving the fridge of its entire alcohol content.)

Macadamia nut?",12
Ross, (looking at the price list) Umm… Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!,11
Rachel," Nope! (She puts one in her mouth and spits it out, then does it again in

another direction.)",18
Phoebe," (seeing her) Get out of here you lurker! (She doesn't move) Go on! Get!

(She throws a quarter at her.)",20
Monica," Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.",10
Chandler," Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love. (They start kissing.)",11
Phoebe," I know. Use it. (Monica and Chandler 

walk off.) Bye, Chandler. Bye Mon.  (goes and sits back down at the slot 

machine. As the lurker walks away, Phoebe kisses her quarter and makes sure no 

one sees her doing so. She puts it in the slot machine and pulls the handle.)",51
Phoebe," Hello, Chandler and Mon. (listens) 

Hello? (Phoebe then sees the old lady lurker taking her seat at the same exact 

slot machine she was just using.) (Gasps) Oh! (Phoebe hangs up the phone and 

runs after her.) You dirty lurker!!! (Phoebe starts to walk off but turns back.) 

Ooh, I'm-I'm sorry, you are the same old lady right? Yeah. Dirty lurker! (walks 

off)",63
Joey," Oh-oh-oh, yeah! (He grabs some towels and takes them to him.) That's

right, you take good care of those babies!",20
Joey," Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!",13
Joey," Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with

it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna

talk to us!",32
Joey," (stopping him) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show!

Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a

song for us! (Singing, to the tune of This Land is Your Land) This hand is your

hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!",61
Rachel," Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.",12
Ross," (gets up) All right. Y'know what? We don’t have to go downstairs! We

can bring Vegas up to us! (He grabs a deck of cards and pulls up a chair.) All right, come

on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. (Deals the cards.) 13.",47
Ross," (does so) Oohh, 23. (Rachel looks at him.) Which is what we play to at

this casino! You win 10 dollars! (Holds out a ten.)",25
Monica," (shaking the dice) A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! (Rolls the

dice.) Yes!",16
Chandler, Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!,11
Chandler," If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!",12
Monica," (To Chandler) We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are

we?",13
Chandler," Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get

the biggest suite in the place! (Everyone cheers) Wait-wait-wait-wait! We (motions

to Monica and him.) get the biggest suite in the place.",35
Monica," All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on! (Rolls the dice.)",12
Chandler," (sees the roll) Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were

fighting about!",16
Monica," Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich—Me neither! Okay, what do

I want now?",15
Chandler," Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; (pause) and

we get married here tonight.",18
Monica, Shut up!! It just got interesting! What did you just say?,11
Chandler, You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.,11
Chandler, Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.,14
Monica, I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.,10
Chandler," Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!

{Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I

guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?",45
Chandler, (spots one) Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?,11
Monica," Nobody move! (To Chandler) Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!",13
Monica, That could be a four or a five. It's your call.,11
Phoebe," Oh well, lost again. (She gets up and slowly moves away. The lurker

scurries in and takes her spot, only this time Phoebe set a trap for her and catches her

in the act.) That's it! You and me, outside!",40
Phoebe," Be cool! (They both pretend to have a nice conversation as the guard

walks by, but after he leaves they both start fighting again.) Okay lady, your lurking

days are over!",31
Phoebe," Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on

to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be

on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do

you leave?",52
Rachel," Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit

me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (She slows down with

each one.)",38
Rachel," Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. (Gets up but

stumbles a little bit.) Whup, okay. (She makes it to the phone and picks it up, without

dialing.) Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We

would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!",58
Ross, That must be our alcohol and beers! (Gets up to answer it.) ,12
Rachel," Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck! (Goes and hugs Joey.)",13
Joey," Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have

to convince my hand twin to cooperate!",20
Ross," I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. (He starts to

sit down on the bed. There's one problem though, he's about two feet to the left of it.

Needless to say, he misses and falls on his butt.) (Looking up at Joey.) Whoa-oh-whoa! Are

you, are you okay?",54
Joey," Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! (He starts to leave, but gets an idea and stops.)

Hey Rach, how you doin'?",19
Ross," (he puts it in his mouth) Nope! Something else. (Throws it back under the

bed.)",15
Rachel," Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?",11
Ross," I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I…I really miss downstairs.",12
Rachel," Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.",12
Ross," Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here. (He points to the

corner of his mouth and they both laugh.)",22
Phoebe, Fine! Here! Take a hike toots! (Gives back her quarter.),10
Phoebe, She sells drugs to kids. (The guard looks at the lurker.),11
Phoebe," No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to

that hell hole!!",19
Monica," Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something

new, something borrowed, and something blue.",19
Chandler," Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue

sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.",21
Chandler," Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.",14
Chandler," No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.",11
Chandler," Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)",12
Joey," No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway… (Shakes his

hands.)",13
Joey," (throws down a small wad of money, and as his hand twin starts to unfold

it, Joey once again brings attention to their special gift to the world. {Y'know, looking

at it now, they really don't have that similar of hands. Joey's are bigger.}) Ooh-ho-ho!

(The dealer stares at him and he stops.)",53
Phoebe," (entering and sitting down at the table.) Hello. My name is Regina

Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? (Looks

down) Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.",45
Phoebe," Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same

hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.",29
Joey," Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at

this table?",16
Joey," Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some

type of a uh, entertainment venue?",19
Phoebe," No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!",10
Joey," Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! (Being dragged out by

the guard) I'm your hand twin!!",21
Chandler," Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?",11
Chandler," Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get

married!",13
Joey, (entering with Phoebe) Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!,10
Phoebe," (to her) Hey! Don’t you give me any of your—Hey! (Sees

Chandler and Monica standing there.)",16
Joey," Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married!

Isn’t that why you guys are here?",19
Phoebe," Well, maybe you wouldn’t have had you (turns to the attendant) run

in the chapel!",15
Joey," I know! I didn't even know they were 

dating again.",10
Chandler," Well, I don't think they are as much 

dating as they are two bottles of vodka walking around in human form. ",21
Phoebe," What’s the big deal, y’know? It’s not like it’s a

real marriage.",12
Phoebe," Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you’re only married in Vegas.",12
Monica," What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you’re

married everywhere.",14
Rachel," Ohhh! (Looks in the mirror and sees that she still has her mustache and

groans.)",15
Rachel," (interrupting) I don't know. 

Do-do you have any clothes on?",10
Ross," No! But we-we didn’t have…sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don’t

remember much about last night, it was such a blur.",21
Ross," I don't know, but I think it was a lot of 

fun. ",12
Rachel," Oh, thank God. )gets out of bed) Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do

anything stupid.",22
Ross," (getting up) Tell me about it. (He sits up on the edge of the bed and has

""Just Married"" written on his back.)",23
Joey," Mornin’ Pheebs. (Sits down.) Well, my movie has officially been

canceled.",11
Phoebe," Oh Joey, I’m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?",11
Joey," Nah, I’m too depressed to eat. I’ll probably eat in like 5

minutes. So I guess I’ll just fly home with you guys, what time’s your flight?",27
Phoebe," No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.",12
Joey," I don’t want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely.

(Gets an idea.) Oh—ooh! How about you come with me?",25
Joey," It’ll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be

our chance to like renew our friendship.",20
Phoebe," All right. Although I don’t think we need one baby, I never stopped

loving you.",15
Chandler," So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?",10
Phoebe," Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.",13
Joey," Oh, here’s where I win all my money back! (Gets up and heads for the

buffet table with Chandler in tow.)",21
Joey," Sure! What’s up? (He grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with a

huge pile of scrambled eggs. Chandler just stares at him and Joey reluctantly gives him a

spoonful.)",31
Joey," Oh my God! That’s huge! (Hugs him.) Wait a minute, why come I

wasn’t invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don’t say,

""Ross."" Do not say, ""Ross.""",31
Chandler," Look, I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get married

yet! Y’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out

of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast.

Y’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?",57
Joey," Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she’s anything

like me, she’s just gonna be relieved.",21
Monica," How do I tell Chandler that it’s too soon. It’s gonna break

his heart, he’s not gonna think that I don’t love him anymore.",24
Monica," Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon.",10
Phoebe," No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable. ",10
Chandler, Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or…,12
Rachel," (To Ross) I don’t know. (To the gang.) What do you mean last night?

Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.",20
Rachel, (gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.),14
Ross, I—They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!,12
Joey," They let you get married when you’re drunk! Most people who get

married in Vegas are drunk!",17
Phoebe," Hell, I’m drunk right now! (They all turn and look at her.) What? I

can’t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I’m on vacation!",23
Rachel," Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)",12
Monica," Yeah-yeah. That guy's finally gonna be 

able to put in that pool. (Both Chandler and her laugh.)",17
Chandler," Now, this one’s free, right? Because you paid for the first 

two, so the third one’s free.",17
Ross," Laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to get

divorced, okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment. ",23
Joey, An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here.,10
Phoebe," You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guy

who gets divorced.",11
Ross," No-no, that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love getting

divorced!",11
Phoebe," Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much

you’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonna

have to divorce it, divorcing guy. (Pause) I’m so drunk.",36
Monica," Maybe. But I-I kind of think we should 

talk about last night. ",12
Chandler," That's a good idea. Because I wanna 

talk about last night too...and I don't know what Pai Gow is.",19
Monica,"  I see. So, what do you think we should do?",10
Chandler," So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have

all the marriages thing? I love you.",22
Monica," That’s a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice

decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!",25
Chandler," Yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay, so

say uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then there’s a definite

sign that we should get married.",33
Monica," All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we

don’t get married.",21
Chandler," That was so unlikely. Well, let’s get married! I guess.",10
Monica," Wait a minute. That wasn’t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard

eight.",15
Chandler," That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!",12
Chandler," Yeah. (They go pack.) We’re doing the right thing, right?",10
Monica," Ohh, of course we are! (They walk up to the elevators.) We left it up to

fate. (Pushes the elevator button.) If we were supposed to get married there would be a

clear-cut sign. (The elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with Chandler

and Monica standing side-by-side holding each other’s hands.)",55
Phoebe," Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. (Joey groans.) Come

on Joey! You can’t win if you don’t ask any (sees that he’s asleep) QUESTIONS!!!",27
Phoebe," Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road six

hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest

stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you

greedy sleeper!",50
Phoebe," Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the

radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.",24
Joey, (starts singing) I wanna rock and roll all night! (Falls asleep.),11
Joey," (to himself) Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! (He opens

his eyes and sees a hitchhiker.)",21
Ross," Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole

annulment thing?",15
Ross, I’m not going to do that. (Rachel glares at him.),10
Ross," Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I’d have to talk you

into this more.",18
Rachel," Okay, see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think

you’re kidding.",12
Ross," I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I, I can’t have three

failed marriages. I can’t. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!

Okay? No, no. That is not going to be ""my thing""! ",32
Ross," Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some

form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box

that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it!",41
Rachel," Ohh, okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? We

absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away 

from each other. ",28
Rachel," No Ross! All right, look, just 

please, take a moment here and think about what you’re asking of me.",19
Ross," And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.

We did make vows.",16
Chandler,"  Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay.

(He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go of

Monica who is only holding on by his neck.)",38
Phoebe," (To Joey) How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a

rape—(She holds her hand in front of the hitchhiker’s face), a rapist or a

killer or something!",30
Joey, Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?!,11
Phoebe," Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep! (To

the hitchhiker) And you, are you a rapist?!",21
Phoebe," No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! (She closes the

partition.) ",11
Ross," Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make

you want to stay married. (Rachel shakes her head.) We register, and you get to

keep all the presents!",36
Rachel," (thinks about it for a second) No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I

thought a lot about how to tell you this and umm... 

Actually, I came up with an analogy about a little goldfish in a pond that 

freezes over in the winter but then I realized that was more of a story about 

what to do when people pick on you. So I'm gonna actually save that for my 

children's book. ",74
Rachel," Oh sorry. Okay, the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay

married.",13
Ross," Oh, okay, y’know what this is? This is a difference of

opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...",19
Rachel," Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the

world’s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I

will!",29
Rachel," Thank you. (He goes to leave.) Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any

such thing as an annulment shower?",20
Phoebe," And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter, so the

ball’s pretty much in your court.",20
Joey," Come on Pheebs! I can’t take this anymore! 

Please talk to me! Let-let me make it up to

you. Huh? (Starts singing.) Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines

on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!",40
Phoebe," Stop it! Stop it no! That’s not fair! Y’know I can’t

resist that beautiful voice!",15
Joey," Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your

friend and I didn’t deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an

important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I

know you.",52
Joey," Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I’ve got a really

good one! I’ve been thinking about it since Kansas.",23
Rachel," Huh, that’s funny. You look like you’re gonna be the…",10
Chandler," All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y’know? I

mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.",27
Monica," I’m sick of the signs! It’s too fast, I’m happy the way

things are!",14
Monica," All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything

stays the same! And you go unpack because it’s been three days and it’s driving

me insane!",27
Chandler," (entering, slowly) Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack

here?",12
Monica," Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it

doesn’t make any sense.",17
Chandler," Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m

saying?",12
Monica," Here’s your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out

and come back in!",17
Chandler," The door hasn’t been locked in five years, but okay! (Runs out.)

Ready?!",13
Chandler," Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can’t get

in!",15
Monica," No, it’s not a sign! It’s a very old key!",10
Rachel," Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?",10
Rachel," Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?",12
Ross," Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?",13
Ross," We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets

up leaving Phoebe in shock.)",16
Joey," I can fix it. Hold on. (He goes and gets a screwdriver from his apartment)

Look out. Look out. (Pries at the door a little bit.)",26
Rachel," Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?",12
Ross," Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?",13
Ross," We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets

up leaving Phoebe in shock.)",16
Phoebe," (running out) Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for

just a second?",17
Rachel," Oh but Phoebe, we’re gonna be late for the movie.",10
Phoebe," Oh, there’s a cab! Taxi!! (The cab stops and she opens the door.)

Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go. (Pushes Rachel in and closes the door.) ",28
Rachel," Yeah, we’re, we’re actually just gonna walk ‘cause

it’s right up there at the Angelica.",15
Phoebe," Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! (She bangs on the cab’s roof and it

pulls away.) (To Ross) You didn’t get the annulment?!!",22
Ross," Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer’s office all I could hear

was, (in a high voice) ""Three divorces. Three divorces!""

Yes, in that high voice! Look, I just don’t want my tombstone

to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces. ",42
Phoebe," Don’t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you

want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y’know? Mine’s

gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.",31
Ross," Look, all I know is I-I can’t have another failed marriage!",11
Phoebe," So okay what? You’re gonna be married to a girl who doesn’t

even know about it?!—Op, woman! Sorry.",18
Ross," Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just

don’t say anything to Rachel, please?",19
Phoebe," Rachel is one of my closest friends. (Pause) Although, being the only

one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!",24
Phoebe," Well then you’d better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go! (Bangs on the

roof again and off they go.)",18
Chandler," Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?",12
Monica," Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out? ",13
Chandler," No, no, I keep trying, y’know? I can get out, ""Joey, I have

too…"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""…go to the

bathroom."" He may think I’m sick.",34
Monica," Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to

get it over with! Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them.

Okay? That’s it.",32
Chandler," Oh, so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna

order me around all the time?",17
Joey," (To Chandler) Hey man, you feeling any better? (Chandler answers him

with some guttural sounds that only he can make and that no human can transcribe.)",26
Chandler," No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey, here’s

the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I’m gonna be moving

out man.",29
Joey," Wow! (Tearing up) Well, uh… Hey! I’m really happy for you guys!

Congratulations! (Kisses Monica on the cheek) See you later. (Starts for the door on the

verge of tears as Monica stops him.)",34
Joey," Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. (Turns towards the door, pauses,

and turns back.) Like you’d believe that. This sucks!",23
Chandler," Look, I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise

you, the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!",27
Joey," (To Monica) Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you’re gonna be moving in

with him I feel it’s my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay?

He’s a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm… Oh-oh he always, he

always umm—Oh, who am I kidding! He’s the best roommate ever! (Hugs Chandler.)",53
Phoebe," Hey. Oh, look, here's an article about 

people who marry people and don't tell them. ",15
Ross," Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend…shacking up. Oh,

that’s great. That’s great. (Kisses and hugs her.)",21
Phoebe," Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled… (Winks

at Ross.)",13
Monica," Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you

please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad?

(Exits.)",32
Phoebe," Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel… Bad news for Rachel, what could

that be?!",14
Ross," Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an

embarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs!",23
Phoebe," Ross, it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced three

times, you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates…",22
Ross," (interrupting) No! No, I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of the

dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy,

and-and, Geologists.",30
Phoebe," Ross, you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and

sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!",22
Ross, Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?,13
Phoebe," Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have

been divorced three times are like 60. (at Ross' glare) 

You're young!",21
Phoebe," (snickers) Well...Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this

embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I’ll show you! Come here.",22
Phoebe," (to the girls) Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced

for the third time, but wouldn’t you date him?",23
Ross," And if you wait right here, I’ll go get Ross. (Phoebe grabs his arm

and prevents him from escaping.)",19
Monica," I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and

she’s the only one left!",22
Chandler," Okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! It’s official,

we’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?",20
Rachel," Ugh, the worse day! Y’know, you think you’re making progress

at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.",19
Chandler," Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me

Sha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously.",18
Rachel," I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of

course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end

of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!",44
Chandler," Well, I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…",10
Monica," Have a seat. (They sit at the table.) Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I

are going to live together, here.",20
Rachel, Oh my God! That’s so great! I’m so happy for you guys! ,12
Rachel," And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are

gonna have such a good time living together!",25
Monica," Yes, we are. (Chandler is frantically trying to get Monica to correct

her.)",13
Rachel," And Chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you

take in the morning because you know Raquel can’t be late.",22
Rachel," Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God… (Gasps and starts to sing)

Come and knock on my door…",18
Ross," …once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage,

wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the

altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get

married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s

fault.",54
Phoebe," Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who

wouldn’t want to date him?",17
Phoebe," Okay, what about you? (Points to Karin) Wouldn’t you want a date?",12
Phoebe," (leaning to him) She said, ""He’s obviously still in love with

this Rachel girl."" (He glares at her.)",18
Ross," This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved

her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me

out here?",34
Phoebe," Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.",11
Ross," We were drunk! I would’ve married uh, Joey with that amount of

alcohol!",13
Phoebe, Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!! ,10
Ross," (to the panel) Look, I’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just

don’t want to be divorced three times.",20
Phoebe," Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants

to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, ""Well done!"" Bravo Meg.",28
Ross," (getting up) Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about

the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now

and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth—(leans

down to Meg’s ear)—Nothing!!",44
Chandler," Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?",12
Monica," Soon! I-I just couldn’t before. You saw how upset Joey got! I

couldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend!",21
Chandler," You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would you

please tell Rachel though?",15
Chandler," Okay. (She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reaches

for one.)",15
Monica," Rach, there’s something uh, important I have to tell you.",10
Monica," No! But, I’m throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little

misunderstanding before.",15
Monica," Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live

together we meant alone together.",19
Rachel," (laughs) Oh my God! Oh, that’s funny, I can’t believe I did

that.",13
Monica," Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn’t clear! I’m

really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There’s

absolutely no rush.",32
Rachel," Ooh, good God, they’re so yummy! (She re-ingests the previously

expelled cookie matter from the tissue.)",16
Joey," (picks up something) And what about this? 

Whose is this?",10
Chandler," Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the

same stuff.",16
Joey," Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night

and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.",27
Joey," Don't you remember that night, it was late 

and I was feeling sick and you said I would feel better tomorrow? ",21
Joey," I don't know. I'm just...just gonna miss 

living with you. (starts to stare at the ceiling)",16
Monica," So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.",14
Monica," Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She

wasn’t angry or sad. (Sits down, slightly disgusted.)",18
Chandler," And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend

cry?",11
Monica," I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too

much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you

guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don’t I deserve a few tears?!! I mean

we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!",58
Joey," Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It’s like the end of an

era! No more J-man and Channie’s!! ",22
Ross," Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk…",11
Ross, This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.,13
Ross," Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda all

ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.",25
Ross," Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? (Russell glares at him.)

I will think about the therapy.",18
Monica," Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our

stuff.",15
Monica," Y’know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long

process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.",22
Monica," Hey Rach, what about this? (She holds up a chrome 5-point star.) Huh?

Who-who gets this? See, I don’t know if I want it because it might be y’know,

too many memories!",32
Monica," I don’t know. (Picks up a big plate from the coffee table.) Hey,

Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.",27
Rachel," Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know,

I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time.",20
Monica," But still, it’s a big change. The end of an era, you might say!",14
Monica," I’m fine! I just, I’m thinking how much it’s an end of

era.",13
Rachel," Oh, all right. But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t

think six years counts as an era.",19
Monica," An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was

significant to me, maybe it wasn’t significant to you!",22
Monica," What is the matter with you?!! Why aren’t you more upset?!

Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean

aren’t you gonna miss me at all?!",33
Rachel," All right, fine, but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s just

a little hard to believe.",16
Rachel," Well y’know, it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff!

Y’know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I

guess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’m

sorry.",43
Monica," Rachel, it’s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.",11
Monica," No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn’t something that we

just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And

it is going to happen.",32
Rachel," (starting to lose her composure) I mean we’re not, we’re not

gonna live together anymore?",15
Rachel, What? Oh my God! I’m gonna miss you so much! (Starts to cry.),13
Ross, It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I…,10
Ross," I… I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now

about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay?

Would I do that if I loved her?",38
Phoebe, I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her.,10
Ross, I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! (He goes into her apartment.),13
Rachel," Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and

everything is changing.",18
Ross," Oh my—Come here! Come here! (He hugs her.) It’s okay.

Everything’s gonna be okay.",14
Joey," So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married,

do you think you and I should hook up?",21
Phoebe," Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy

rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out.",23
Phoebe," I know. Then, I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money and

you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.",19
Phoebe," But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married.

We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will be

easy because of Rachel’s drinking problem.",30
Phoebe," I don’t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and

I kill him.",18
Phoebe," Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his

breath for almost four minutes! ",17
Joey, (To Chandler) Dude! What are yo—you trying to kill me?!,10
Rachel," (entering from her room) Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.",10
Phoebe," Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?",13
Joey," Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is

she cute?",16
Chandler," Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none

of us know anything about?",17
Phoebe," Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her

all the time! DENISE!!!!!",18
Joey," Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin’ uh, I’m gonna have an extra room

over at my place…",17
Joey," Yeah, why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We could

stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday’s right?",25
Rachel," Yeah, yeah I think I’m gonna find my own place.",10
Chandler, Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man!,10
Phoebe," So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?",15
Ross," I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so

I eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset.

I-I just comforted her, as a friend.",40
Phoebe," Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson. (Tries to take a bite out of

Ross’s cookie.)",16
Ross," (grabs back his cookie) It was a hug! 

Okay? A simple hug. I was a friend being a friend to a friend. ",22
Phoebe," Use the word ""friend"" more. Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?",19
Phoebe," Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her

head! That’s why, that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love

when they hug them! (Ross is staring at her dumbfounded.) Oh come on Ross, you’re a

scientist. ",44
Ross," I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in

my face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh…coconutty. (Phoebe

raises her eyebrows.) What?! Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe

it means I have feelings for coconuts!",50
Phoebe," (taking his coffee) Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all

right? Rachel’s not in the same place you are.",21
Ross," (grabbing back his coffee) If the place you are referring too is being in

love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!",31
Phoebe," Okay, I didn’t understand that, but y’know, maybe that’s

‘cause you were speaking the secret language of love! ",18
Joey," Hey! (To Chandler) Dude, some guy just called for you.",10
Joey," I don’t know! How about, ""Thanks for taking the message.""

Jeez! (Exits.)",12
Monica," Okay listen, y’know when you move in Rachel’s room is gonna be

empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?",24
Monica," Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With

a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could

have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved

staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.",60
Chandler," Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it

could be a game room, y’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space

Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!",40
Chandler," Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting

idea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely.""",21
Monica," Oh, I’m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk

about it, but no.",16
Monica," I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The

beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.",22
Chandler, Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It’s the oldest game!,10
Chandler," I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room,

especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!",19
Chandler," No, I’m not mocking you, (in a mocking voice) or you beautiful

guest room. (Exits.)",15
Joey," But you’re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out

today. (Shows him the paper.)",17
Joey," Yeah? I just figured y’know, after living with you it’d be an

interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y’know? Someone I can learn

from, someone-someone who’s different than me. And what’s more different than

me; a guy who’s not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? (Points to his head.)

Not just a hat rack my friend!",62
Phoebe," Umm, I’m trying to move that pencil. (There’s a pencil lying

on the table.)",14
Rachel," Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every 

place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; 

(Points to one and starts to read it.) ""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, 

non-ugly."" ",40
Phoebe," That's probably just some 12 year old 

kid trying to get girls to call. ",14
Phoebe," Wait, no, look at this! (Points to one.) (Reading) ""Two bedroom,

two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay…"" Oh, yeah, but it’s on

the ground floor.",27
Ross," Okay, there’s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he’s going

on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh,

you interested?",32
Rachel," That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I love 

Warren! Oh, wait-wait. Is he the guy that asked you for 

naked pictures of me? (Ross thinks about it.) That doesn't matter, he won't be 

there! Thank you!",39
Ross," Don’t thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that

erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.

(Rachel just looks at him.) Here’s Warren’s number.",32
Rachel," Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! (Jumps up.) Oh, thank

you! ",16
Phoebe," Umm, I’m talking about that which you already know but won’t

admit. You love her again; you re-love her!",19
Phoebe," I can’t believe you won’t just admit it! (Pause) Okay, just

promise me that you won’t do anything stupid.",19
Ross," Look, we’re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?",12
Rachel," (returning from calling Warren) Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already

subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I’m never gonna find anything.",22
Rachel," I would love to live with you Ross; that’s-that’s great! Thank

you!",12
Ross," Well, I’m-I’m just glad I could, y’know, help you out.",10
Phoebe," Wow! I’m-I’m so happy for you guys. (To Ross) This is so-so,

not stupid.",14
Rachel," Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was

gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero!",26
Rachel," Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! (Kisses

him on the cheek and exits.) ",20
Ross," Oh please! (He sits down.) (To Phoebe) You’re gonna say things now,

aren’t ya?",14
Phoebe," No. No, I won’t. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing

happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her

and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And

that’s how she ended up living with me! (Ross looks at her.) (Pause) Okay,

that’s a lie.",65
Phoebe," Denise! (gets up angrily) No one ever 

listens to ME!!!!!!!!!!",10
Chandler," Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have a

game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t get

girls, and now I can ‘em—Now, I have you. (Monica glares at him.) Not-not

that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see

women…",65
Monica," Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think of

something to do with the room together.",21
Chandler," That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us

both to enjoy the room.",18
Chandler," Hey, y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we can

make in the living room?",16
Chandler," Yeah, I mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture to

make room for my chair. (Kisses her and heads into the living room.)",25
Monica," Well, it’s a set and they should probably stay together.",10
Chandler," Oh, that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over.",10
Chandler," Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything

here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!",31
Monica," Yeah-yeah, y’know what? Yeah, that’s it-that’s it,

everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That’s-that’s what I said! Oh

come on, Chandler! I’m talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn’t

match! Where is it gonna go?!",39
Monica, Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!,12
Chandler," All right! That’s fine! That’s fine! I won’t bring over

the chairs! I won’t bring anything over! I wouldn’t want to ruin the ambiance

over here at Grandma’s place!! (Storms out.)",31
Joey," (exiting from Chandler’s room with the new roommate) Everything on

your application looks really good—Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your

friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",37
Joey," Whoa!! Now look, don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. I want you to

really think about your answers. Okay?",19
Chandler," (entering) You can call off the roommate search! (To the potential

roommate) Hi! I’ll be living here. (Heads for the bathroom.)",21
Joey," Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the

apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it.",22
Joey," That thing was a hazard! (To the potential roommate) I’m very safety

conscious.",13
Ross," Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.",12
Rachel," Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler

had a big fight and they’re not moving in.",22
Ross," What do you mean, they’re not moving in? They-they’re still

moving in right?",13
Rachel," No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.",14
Rachel," Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I’m also really psyched

‘cause I don’t have to move in here!",20
Ross," What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a

room?! I mean, that is so silly!",19
Ross," Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people

I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the

silliness!",32
Chandler," Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly! (Monica mocks

him and he joins in.)",17
Ross," (stopping them) Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I’ve known you

both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as

you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away

over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?",56
Chandler," Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for

the love.",17
Ross," Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?",11
Ross," (jumping up) Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!

(Storms out.)",16
Ross," You’re never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in

again. That’s great news right—I mean for them. Right?",21
Ross," Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.",12
Rachel," Yeah. Y’know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really

appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don’t you think it’s

gonna be weird?",29
Ross," No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you

still in that place?",21
Ross," Good! Me neither! So it’s not a problem. We’re just two friends

who happen to be roommates.",17
Rachel," Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.",11
Rachel," Yeah! I’m gonna have a boyfriend, you’re gonna have a

girlfriend…",11
Rachel," But y’know what, if you think it’s gonna be okay we’ll

just work out a system. Y’know, it’ll be like college, I’ll hang a hanger

on the door and put a sign, ""Come back later, I’m gettin’ lucky.""

(Laughs.)",39
Ross," (laughs as well, but for a different reason) Yeah, I didn’t think of

that.",14
Ross," So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really

big step! And-and what’s the rush?!",21
Chandler," He’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!",11
Ross," No, I-I-I’m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you

start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up!",25
Monica," Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.",14
Ross," Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn’t about the room, this is

about what the room…represents! And unfortunately, this room (Points to Rachel’s

room) could destroy you!!",28
Ross," Fine! It’s your life! (Starts to storm out mad about his failed

attempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one last

time.) I just don’t want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you

move in together, (Monica and Chandler just stare at him.) but that’s what you want,

there’s nothing I can do. (Opens the door and tries one more time.) DON’T DO

IT!!!!! (Finally leaves.)",78
Chandler, Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.,10
Monica," This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could

see the TV and it’s still walking distance to the kitchen.",25
Chandler, Oh that’s so sweet! I want to show you something too!,11
Chandler," Y’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs

and hang it over our bed. Because, that’s you and I together! Merge!",26
Phoebe," (singing) I found you in my bed! 

                         

How’d you whined up there? 

                         

You are a mystery!

                         

Little black curly hair!

                         

Little black curly hair!

                         

Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly

hair…………",36
Phoebe," Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please

give me money so I can buy a computer.",22
Rachel," No, the other thing. I really think it’s great they work things

out.",13
Rachel," Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street

and make a copy?",20
Rachel," Thank you. (Gets up) Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy,

there’s no turning back.",18
Ross," Yeah, I’m-I’m sure. (Deadpan) Yeah, get out of here before I

change my mind. (She exits)",16
Joey," Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good

idea?",16
Joey," Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you

know it you’re right where you don’t want to be! Back together!",26
Ross," Ehh, I don’t, I don’t think so. She’s already talked about

y’know, dating other guys.",15
Joey," That’s not gonna work out! Then she’s gonna come home all weepy

and you’ll be tellin’ her, ""Oh that’s okay. You’ll find

someone."" And then, bamn! She finds you!",29
Joey," I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you

again! Now, is that what you want?",21
Joey," Here she comes. Hold on, I’m gonna make your life much easier.",12
Rachel," All right, well the place was closed. I’ll just copy it later.",12
Joey," Or not. Uh, Rach, why don’t you just move in with me? (Rachel sighs.)",14
Joey," No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no… It’s okay, I mean I—look Rach, I

know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing, but we don’t have

to do that!",26
Rachel," Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a

minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.",21
Joey," Come in. Thanks for comin’ back, umm, okay there have been a lot of

people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the

finalists!",32
Joey," Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure

our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I’m gonna say a word

and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.",44
Joey," Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but—bye-bye! (He ushers her

out the door.)",13
Monica, This bottle opener. (She grabs it off of the freezer door.),11
Ross," How weird is that? Y’know? You’re moving in with me and have the

one thing I don’t have. It’s like uh, in a way you-you complete me

(Phoebe glares at him) kitchen.",32
Phoebe," That she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall

in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll just

be happy. Y’know? You’re just, you’re very sad.",35
Ross," Oh…my…God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with

Rachel!",12
Ross," Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you’re obsessed with her.

It’s always, ""Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?"" ""Ross,

why-why are you moving in with Rachel?"" ""When are you gonna confess your secret

marriage to Rachel?"" You want her!",44
Ross," (answering it) Uh-oh, saved by the bell. (On phone) Hello?",10
Monica," Hey Rach, aren’t these candlesticks (holds up a pair) mine?",10
Monica," (under her breath) That you’re a liar. (Hides the candlesticks in a

drawer.)",13
Ross," (on phone) No-no-no, that’s great! I’ll be there Monday. And

thank you again! (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up) (To All) Umm, that was the head of the

Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!",34
Ross," Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate,

huh? They loved it. ",17
Ross," I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it’s

temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that

look great on a mailbox, huh? ""Professor Geller.""",41
Rachel, Ohh! Oh God! (Laughs her way into the living room.) ,10
Phoebe," Well, she told me that I’m gonna die this week, so I’m kinda

bummed about that.",16
Phoebe," Yeah, and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings,

but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.",25
Phoebe," I don’t—she said y’know that I’d have triplets! But

she also said one of them would be black.",18
Chandler, Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?,12
Phoebe," No, ‘cause she didn’t tell me I was gonna die until the very

end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’ve

only got a week left, y’know? I’ve really gotta start living now! (So she

picks up the latest copy of Car and Driver (a U.S. auto magazine), leans back, and

starts reading.)",63
Ross," Hey uh, well, today’s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it

out on you guys, do you, do you mind?",23
Ross," (he starts reading directly from his cards word for word very quietly)

""There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these

theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct…""",32
Joey," (interrupting him) Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that

piece of paper?",16
Joey," Well, I’ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper

that didn’t have naked chicks on it.",22
Ross," Ohh! Okay! Okay. (Resumes reading word for word from the card) ""There

are three (pauses and looks at Joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.

(Pauses and darts his eyes between Chandler and Rachel.) (Rachel starts laughing) Each of

these theories (glances at Phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at Chandler)

into…""",52
Ross," Open with a joke? It’s a university, not a comedy club!",11
Chandler," Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about

Chuckles University?!",12
Rachel," Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?",10
Ross," I-I-I don’t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it.

Y’know what? I’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.",28
Chandler," That’s the way I did it ‘til I was 19.

(Ross looks at him.) All right, 20. (Joey looks at him.) 

23. ",22
Joey," Ooh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me,

I’m kinda….",15
Joey," Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a move called

benefits lapsed.",13
Chandler," Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance

expired because, you didn’t work enough last year.",18
Joey," (reads it) Oh, I can’t believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance

I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? And it wouldn’t matter. Now I

gotta be careful?!",34
Chandler," I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to (pauses) stop

catching on fire.",14
Joey," All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my

agent.",17
Chandler," Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.",12
Joey," (mocks him, in a whiney voice) …look both ways before you cross the

street. (Turns and walks headlong into the closed door.)",22
Phoebe," Ugh, it’s so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way,

do you think you could—(Groans, hacks, and then freezes with her eyes open and her

tongue hanging out.)",29
Phoebe," I was preparing you for my—didn’t you think I was dead? Did

that not come off?",16
Rachel," Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost you

forever. Pheebs, you lie down?",18
Phoebe," Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm,

wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.",25
Monica," No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some

for myself.",17
Rachel, Yeah. (Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.),12
Ross, It went great! And I didn’t need any jokes or naked chicks either!,13
Rachel," Wow, that’s great Ross, I’m sorry we weren’t more

supportive before.",11
Ross," I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself.

Everyone’s all, ""Ross you have to be funny and sexy."" Well, I proved them

wrong! And now, I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.",40
Joey," What are you talkin’ about? I never left you! You’ve always been

my agent!",14
Joey," Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.",12
Rachel," Well, we’re a little early, the lecture doesn’t end for 15

minutes.",12
Rachel," Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There’s some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was

a Kappa. (to them) Hey sisters! (They ignore her.) (To Monica) Wow, we really are bitches.",29
Ross," (to the class) Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the

laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact

sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when—(sees Monica and Rachel.) Oh bloody hell.",39
Joey," (in obvious pain) Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me

tomorrow and I’ll have my health insurance back in no time.",25
Chandler," That’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?",11
Joey," Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting

weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But

um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.",38
Chandler, This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!,12
Joey," No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything

it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and shows

Chandler.)",30
Joey," Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he was

using.) Damn you 15s!",19
Ross," Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring!

I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British

accent just came out.",39
Ross," (in his British accent) I’m sorry, I’ve got plans with my

sister.",12
Monica, (in an Irish accent) Monica Gellerrr. (She rolls her ‘R’),10
Ross," (in accent) Right, will you excuse us for one moment? (Takes Monica

aside.) (In his normal voice.) What are you doing?",21
Monica," (normal voice) Oh, you can have an accent and I can’t?! (To an

exiting student in accent.) Top ‘O the morning to ya laddies!",24
Rachel," (in an Indian accent) Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.",14
Chandler," Hey, will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.)

Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!",22
Joey," Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it’s

getting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing.",19
Chandler," I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just

get that thing…pushed back in.",19
Joey," Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I

don’t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in

I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll probably start

with that laser eye surgery too.",53
Chandler," Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a

little laser eye surgery won’t fix!",17
Joey," Look, I’m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here (He

puts his hand down his pants, like Al Bundy on Married…With Children always

used to do.) it doesn’t hurt that bad.",36
Phoebe," No, we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though, okay?

‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday.",19
Phoebe," No-no, it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!",14
Joey," Ooh wait. Could I come back and haunt 

Monica and Rachel when they're in the shower?",16
Ross," (entering) Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to

speak in a British accent?! What do I do?",23
Monica," (in a British accent) Well why don't you 

call Mummy and Daddy?",12
Ross," I'm serious! Someone's gonna find out I'm 

a fake and then they're never gonna offer me a job!",18
Monica," Why don’t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people

will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.",24
Rachel," Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re

probably not even listening to you!",20
Rachel, Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.,10
Ross, Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?,11
Joey," (in a gravely, painful voice) Okay. ""Hey, Timmy, I’ve got a

surprise for you.""",14
Joey," Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I’ll just—hold on one second. (He

turns around and puts his hand in his pants and groans in relief.) (In a relaxed voice.)

""Hey Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you!""",36
Joey," So that’s why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!

(He turns, looks at the bag and realizes he won’t be able to pick it up.)",30
Joey," Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One,

point to a bag today. (She just looks at him.) I didn’t get it, did I?",29
Joey, Hi. I’m Joey Tribbiani; I’m here to audition for (Groans) man.,11
Rachel," Okay! (Picks up the phone and starts dialing.) (In an Irish accent)

""Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we’d like you

to come on board with us full time! (Hangs up.)",36
Phoebe," Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I’m not going die!",11
Phoebe, Because my psychic is dead! She must’ve read the cards wrong!,11
Joey," Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me

take a shower.",17
Joey," Hi Alex! (to the director) And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my

pants. (Holds them both up.)",22
Joey," ""Take could care of your Momma son."" (Alex just looks at him and

the director motions for him to continue so he tries it again.) ""Take could care of

your Momma son."" (Alex does nothing.) ""Come on son! Your Momma’s good

people!""",42
Joey," Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right

up until you say action?",22
Joey," (he stops screaming at action) ""Take good care of your Momma

son."" (Again Alex does nothing.)",16
Chandler," I’m sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don’t you uh, lift up your

shirt? (He does.) Take a look at this kiddo. (Alex finally starts crying.) We

have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!",33
Ross," (in his head) All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out,

phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory (pronounced

the British way) the team would never have identified (British) the initial errors in

their carbon dating analysis (British). Were there any questions at this point? (One

student raises his hand.) Yes. (Points to him.)",61
Ross," (British) Come again? What’s-what’s this nonsense? (Giggles.)

(American.) All right, I’m-I’m not English. I’m from Long Island. I was

really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I’m sorry. So, if we could just

get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? (Everyone raises their hands)

About paleontology. (They all put their hands down.) All right, look I was just trying to

make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is

really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you

just give me another chance to make a good impression…",107
Rachel," Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just

never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!",30
Joey," Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don’t hold

back. (He dons his protective helmet (Why, I have no clue.) and Phoebe picks up a wooden

baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)",41
Phoebe, We’re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.,10
Rachel," I cannot believe that you didn’t tell me that we are still

married!!",13
Rachel," When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! (To All) Ross

didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.",20
Ross," Okay, maybe it wasn’t my best decision. But I just couldn’t face

another failed marriage.",15
Chandler," Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this

was a successful marriage?",19
Ross," Rach, come on, if you think about it, it’s actually kinda funny. (He

laughs, and he laughs alone.) Okay, maybe it’s best not to think about it.",27
Phoebe," Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!",11
Chandler," Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you’re not married to

anymore of us are ya?",17
Ross," Look, Rach, I-I was going to tell you. I 

just wanted to do it, um, my own way. ",18
Joey," (gets up and heads for the kitchen) 

Hey-hey-hey-hey...Hey!...Hey! Look, in Ross' defense, okay..(tries to think of 

something but can't so he just goes for the refrigerator.) ",26
Joey, Na-uh! (To everyone there) Hey did anybody lose their keys?,10
Monica," Joey, why don’t you put them in the lost and found?",11
Joey," There’s a lost and found? (Gunther sets the box up on the table.) My

shoe! (Grabs it out of the box.)",21
Joey," Well, I didn’t realize until I got home. I wasn’t gonna walk all

the way back down here with one shoe! Y’know what? I’m gonna go find that

guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield. (Goes to do so.)",41
Chandler," Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I’ll be sure to give

him your shoe.",17
Phoebe," (coming in from the bathroom) Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen,

how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!",27
Monica," Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!",10
Phoebe," Okay, well I’ll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by

the way, they’re not actually puppies, they’re Frank and Alice’s triplets.

Okay, see ya! (Exits.)",27
Phoebe," (stops) Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank

and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I’m nervous ‘cause I’ve

never done that before by myself!",30
Chandler," Yeah, I’m gonna pass. ‘Cause I was kinda iffy when it was

puppies.",13
Monica," Come on Chandler, come on! It’ll give us great practice for

when—(realizes what she’s about to say and changes)—people with babies come

to visit.",24
Rachel," So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross’s, and

I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.",27
Phoebe," What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while,

I don’t have a roommate.",20
Rachel," That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?",11
Rachel," (deadpan) Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.",13
Rachel," Well sure, if you say you’re gonna take care of everything I have

no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! (Grabs them from him.) All right, now

I’m gonna do this my way and I don’t want to hear a peep out of you!",46
Rachel," Ross! Y’know what, I just got—why? Why did you do this?!",11
Rachel," Well, y’know what? Thanks to you I’m half way there! Ugh! Oh!

I am so mad! Ross, I don’t think I have ever been this angry!",26
Ross, What about the time I said we were on a break?,11
Joey," Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?",12
Joey, (checks in the window to make sure it has them) It’s got ‘em!,13
Phoebe," (rapidly) I’m doing okay. I think it’s going well. Do you

think they’re having fun? Am I talking too fast?",20
Monica," Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it’s going great. Look at Chandler

with little baby girl Chandler.",16
Chandler," Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right,

Coach Ruben. (Tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenly

smells something. It’s times like these I’m glad Smell-O-Vision hasn’t been

invented.) Do you know what Pheebs? When you’re done over there, we kinda have a

situation over here too. (Phoebe is changing hers.)",63
Phoebe," Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.",10
Chandler," See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been

playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.",24
Chandler," I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our

own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y’know Mon, you can be in

charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put

their hands around… (He degrades into baby talk, but he means when they grab his

finger.)",66
Phoebe," That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.",13
Chandler," Okay, I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.",12
Monica," This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the

restaurant.",15
Phoebe, Yeah? (Checking the final diaper) Well this is not what I ordered.,12
Joey," Hey babies! Oh, I’m having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche

I’ve got the keys too, still there!",19
Joey," You should see the treatment I get when I’m with that car! People are

friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about

my equity investments.",33
Joey," The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! (Chandler wipes his

forehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used. He drops it disgustedly.) But I

figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they’re gonna start to

think that I don’t own it. So I figured I’ll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a

bucket and some soap I can borrow?",67
Monica," Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing

compound.",15
Monica," I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of

the building, so I washed it.",21
Joey," And that’s just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her

upstate.",17
Joey," Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.",12
Joey," Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I’m just polishing her up.",13
Joey," Sure. Here. (He hands them over.) I’ll uh, save your parking spot.",12
Phoebe," I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know

why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.",25
Chandler," (entering) Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they

can meet Krog! (He holds up this Xena-like warrior action figure.)",24
Monica," Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone’s eye out!",12
Chandler, He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!,11
Phoebe," No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look

at his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up.",23
Monica," It's just not an appropriate toy for 

1-year-olds. Or 30-year-olds. ",10
Chandler," They’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over

protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!",30
Chandler," Glass, sand, whatever. (Walks out as Monica and Phoebe turn to check

on the babies again.)",16
Monica," Oh it’s so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able

to put both legs over your head.",22
Chandler," (entering) All right. (Clears throat) I thought about it and maybe

you’re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.",20
Chandler," Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y’know? And it

turns out I was wrong. And now it’s lodged in my throat. (Mimics a cat trying to

cough up a hairball.) (He does it again.)",38
Monica," Damnit! Y’know this whole time we were concentrating on watching

the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler! (He does it again.)",23
Rachel," Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",11
Ross," Okay, I’m sorry, this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin,

I’m not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything!

Look, I’ll consummate this marriage right here, right now!",34
Rachel," Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!

(To the stenographer) And could you strike ""Consummated like bunnies"" from the

record?",24
Rachel," Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.",14
Ross," (stands up) That’s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with

your funny, funny form!",17
Rachel," (stands up as well) What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like

bunnies nonsense!",15
Ross," And what—(notices the stenographer is still typing)—What are you

typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don’t get the annulment. Don’t

type that! What?! Stop typing! (He goes over to where the stenographer is typing and in

the process pushes Rachel out of his way.) Hey! Stop typing! (He’s still typing.)

Stop typing! Stop typing!!",58
Rachel," (to the judge) Okay, do you see, do you see what you’re keeping me

married too?!",16
Rachel," All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I

am not leaving here until I get one!",24
Rachel, And thank you for your time. (They both beat a hasty retreat.),12
Joey," (entering wearing nothing but Porsche clothes) So the Porsche guy took his

car back.",14
Joey," No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I

own a Porsche.",19
Monica," And people will think you own a Porsche because you’re wearing the

clothes?",13
Joey," Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the

car! Right?",16
Phoebe," Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.",11
Joey," Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. (Starts to

leave.)",15
Joey," Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to

her! (Storms out.)",16
Chandler," Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.",10
Monica," All right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room.",10
Phoebe," What?! No, you can’t, you can’t leave me here with them!

We’re baby-sitting! ",13
Monica," The babies are asleep, I’m sure you’ll be okay on your own for

a while!",15
Phoebe," But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team!

We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!",19
Monica," He’s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we’ve got to

go to the hospital.",15
Phoebe," But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just

gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.",24
Phoebe," A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital! (They don’t

stop.) No! What would, what would Krog do? (They ignore her and Phoebe is left alone.)",27
Rachel," Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!!",11
Ross, That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!,12
Ross," The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a

divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? (Walks on.)",23
Phoebe," Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right?

Okay, I’m gonna take that spit bubble as, ""Yeah, I do!"" Okay, after I get

rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I’ll set you up with a clean one. (She throws it at

the garbage without looking, misses, and knocks over a vase and flowers, which fall to the

floor and break.) Okay, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you. I just have to

clean that up. Okay? ‘Cause let’s face it, we’re at Monica’s. (She

crawls over, disposes of the diaper, picks up the flowers, and the vase.) I broke it. All

right. Well, that’s just the way that goes. (She throws out both the flowers and the

vase.) Okay, good. (She turns around and only counts two babies.) Why are there only two

of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can’t answer. (She starts looking for her) Leslie?

Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! (She

turns around and finds that Leslie has managed to crawl into the bottom drawer of the TV

cabinet.) Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! (She picks

her up and notices a surprise is waiting in the drawer.) Oh, you’re a lot

mischievous! Well, it’ll dry. (Closes the drawer with her foot.) (To Leslie) Okay,

you sit with your brother and sister now—who aren’t there! (They both have

disappeared as well.)",248
Chandler," Well, let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy

the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.",20
Phoebe," Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed

‘em, bathed ‘em, and put ‘em to bed.",22
Phoebe, I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!,12
Chandler," Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies

all by herself.",17
Monica," You’re right, you’re right I shouldn’t freak out.

‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!",24
Chandler," (pause) Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!",10
Rachel," (deadpan) Oh honey thank God you’re home, I was getting worried.",11
Ross," I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I’ve already signed everything

and I put little ‘X’s where you need to sign.",21
Ross," Y’know, I-I—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?",10
Rachel," Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!",12
Ross," Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you

told me you loved me after I was already married!",25
Rachel," Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was

in love with you!",18
Ross," You’re right. That’s very different. So let’s, let’s

just sign the papers. All right? (Sits down and Rachel keeps standing there.) What?",22
Rachel," Uh-hmm. (Just as Rachel finishes signing her name, Ross yanks each page

out of the way.)",16
Rachel," Okay Ross, we’re—wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a

little confession.",14
Rachel," Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we

were married?",15
Rachel," And uh, yeah, I didn’t really, I didn’t want to say anything,

but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the

casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I

thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first

to get married, and then (Ross joins in) to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us

into this mess.",92
Ross," So then if-if—I mean if you think about it, this is all (Pause.) your

fault.",15
Ross," I’ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I

would be divorcing you.",19
Rachel," I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one

that stuck. And it wouldn’t be a secret, and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner

at Pizza Hut. (They both laugh.)",37
Rachel," No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.",13
Ross," That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I should

probably get these to my lawyer’s office.",21
Rachel," Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.",10
Joey," I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping.

(The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the

same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses

it. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)",68
Chandler," (watches Joey for a moment) Okay! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stick

so that he’s scratching his back with it.) Listen, I’m gonna be moving out so you

will be in charge of paying the rent.",36
Chandler," No, just the months you actually want to live here.",10
Chandler," Okay, here is the phone bill. (Hands it to Joey.)",10
Chandler," That’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this

whole me moving out on thing, so why don’t I just—why don’t I just cover

you for a while?",31
Joey," No! Forget it! Okay—I mean thanks, but I’m done taking money

from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what’s next? Come on.",25
Chandler," Okay uh, here’s the electric bill. (Hands it to him.)",10
Chandler," So, we’ll do the rest of the bills later then?",10
Phoebe, So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?,11
Chandler," No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t

take it.",16
Chandler," I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know?

But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride.",27
Phoebe," Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and

put on little skits. Whatever you want.",22
Chandler, Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?,11
Chandler," Okay! (They kiss) So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?",12
Monica," Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with

Rachel we thought we’d go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving

in with Phoebe.",32
Phoebe," What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not

your birthday!",15
Phoebe, Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?,12
Chandler," Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we’d do nothing.",11
Ross," Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys

would come over and watch it.",16
Joey," I don’t know Ross, not if you’re gonna talk about how you gave

up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.",22
Ross, I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!,12
Monica," You’re not dressed yet?! We’re supposed to start having fun in

15 minutes!",13
Monica," Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that

you’re packed. ",14
Rachel," Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her

opinion on what I should wear tonight.",20
Phoebe," My God, I can’t get a minute of peace around this place.",12
Monica," (entering) Rachel, I need to borrow—You’re not packed!!!!

You’re not packed even a little bit!",15
Rachel," No, no don’t get mad because look—this is what happened. So

I-I started packing, then I realized, ""What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!""

Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
",42
Monica," (grabs a bag of those Styrofoam peanuts) I’ll be coordinator! Oh my

God! I’m so sorry, I didn’t get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help!

Okay? You can help, can’t you Phoebe?",34
Monica," All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift

things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!",25
Phoebe," Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for

everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves! (The guys scramble for the

door.)",27
Monica," (entering and interrupting the guy’s escape attempt) Okay! The

movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help!

Chandler, we’re gonna start with…",30
Monica, I thought you said you were going to do nothing.,10
Monica," It’s almost 8 o’clock, it’s almost past his bedtime.

Where-where is he?",12
Monica, Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!,12
Ross," Of course he is! What, do you think I’d just use my son as-as an

excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?",25
Ross, (to the guys) I gotta go make a fake Ben.,10
Chandler," Oh, I wish I’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.",14
Joey," Oh that’s okay. Hey, actually in a way it’s kinda nice. Me,

bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!",23
Chandler," Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night.

What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?",28
Joey," What, are you crazy? You haven’t beaten me once since my injury

plagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.",26
Chandler," If you know that you are going to win 

though, what difference does it make? ",15
Chandler," Okay, let’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.",10
Phoebe," You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the

time… (She starts laughing hysterically.) You don’t remember?",22
Rachel," I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m

leaving.",12
Phoebe," Well, this doesn’t have to be so sad though. Y’know? Maybe

instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other, you should like

think of the things you’re not gonna miss.",34
Rachel," Uh well, I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never

allowed to move the phone pen. (Laughs. Monica lags behind the laugh a little bit.)",28
Phoebe," Good that’s a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y’know? Does

Rachel move the phone pen?",15
Monica, Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.,10
Monica," Yeah, well I don’t think it really counts if you have to read them

off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.",27
Rachel," So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler?

Or your mom?",16
Joey," (scores) Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That’s like 500 bucks you owe me!

Whoo-ho-hoo! (Goes over to the fridge and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.)

$500 that is a loooot of electricity! (By the way, there’s nothing in the fridge.)

Whoo-ho-ho! (Notices the sparseness of the fridge.) I gotta buy some food.",54
Chandler," Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one

goal, $1,000.",16
Chandler, No! No! No! No—(Joey looks at him)—one can beat me.,10
Chandler," See? Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do

all the kicking.",16
Monica," Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Ross! (To Rachel) See? Other people call me!",12
Ross," Oh, I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi.",12
Ross," Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. (He holds the phone to the fake Ben he has

created out of a pumpkin.) Oh, I guess he doesn’t feel like talking right now.

He’s smiling though! Okay, talk to you later. (hangs 

up the phone and sits down to turn on the game. He looks over at his fake son.) 

You know, Daddy was gonna be a basketball player. ",67
Phoebe," Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember

the roller blades?",17
Rachel," You know what else I’m not gonna miss? ""I’m Monica. I

wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!""",24
Monica," ""Hi I’m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I’d

better wash it and shrink it!""",17
Rachel," ""I’m Monica, I don’t get phone messages from interesting

people. Ever!""",11
Monica," ""Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate

Ross!""",15
Rachel," ""Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend! So I guess I’ll

just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!""",27
Phoebe," Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner

reservations. (Phoebe dumps a drawer full of makeup into a box.)",24
Joey," This sucks man! The last night you’re here and I lose the two most

important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.",24
Chandler," Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a

little uh, a little Blackjack? (Holds up a deck of cards.)",24
Chandler," Okay, uh, how about, how about—y’know what? We could play a

new game. A new game, it’s fun.",18
Chandler," I’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, it’s really easy and

really, really fun.",14
Chandler," Okay, here you go. (He deals out two cards each.) I have two queens,

what do you have?",18
Chandler," Oh yeah! Okay, let’s play again. (He deals out two cards each

again.) What do you got?",17
Phoebe," Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you,

because she’s the one who’s leaving. It’s harder for her!",25
Monica," Well, maybe you’re right—She made fun of my phone pen!",10
Phoebe," I know, I took it hard too. She's in 

there right now, crying. I can hear her. ",17
Monica," (goes up to the door to listen) She's 

not crying.",10
Monica," Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about—What are you doing? (She

sees that Rachel is unpacking.)",16
Rachel," I’m not moving! (She re-hangs a picture, crookedly.) Is that

picture straight?",12
Monica, It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!,10
Rachel," Hey, y’know what? You’re the one who wants to make this big

change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to

leave?!",31
Monica," How about, you’re moving!! (Grabs a bunch of clothes and throws

them into a box. What follows is a brief sequence of Rachel unpacking and Monica packing

the same stuff over and over again as Rachel chants ""No."" and Monica chants

""Yes."")",42
Rachel," Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! (She knocks over

Monica, grabs a box, and runs into the kitchen.)",21
Rachel," Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! (Monica starts

chasing Rachel around the table.)",19
Phoebe," Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what’s going on here. Okay,

you guys… STOP!! (They stop.) I know that, I know that you’re

acting mad because you think that it’ll make it easier to leave. But deep down

you’re still really sad. Deep-deep down.",47
Chandler," It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That

my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?",24
Chandler," Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.",14
Chandler," Hey, I didn’t make up the rules. Now, after you receive the

doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your

total to 1,500. (Joey gets excited.) Don’t get to excited because that’s not

gonna happen unless you get—No way! (He takes the top card, which is the two of

clubs. Of course, any card would’ve won. Chandler pays him.)",68
Monica," Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label

it, ""What were you thinking?""",18
Rachel," Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on

Chandler.",15
Phoebe," Hey you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I

don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.",20
Phoebe," You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up

like that with Rachel. I still like you!",22
Monica," Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know I-I-I said some

really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that

make her a good roommate.",28
Rachel, Yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet.,12
Monica," Do you wanna live outside?! Because it’s gettin’ cold! (To

Phoebe) She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things

she thinks that I’d like.",31
Monica," When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.",13
Phoebe, That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.,11
Monica," When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a

blanket.",16
Monica," And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was

really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And

now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)",52
Phoebe," Okay Rachel, I can’t wait to live with you! And you know

what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We’ll have

so much fun!!",31
Monica," Kinda. (She hugs Phoebe and looks out the window. She moves closer to it

to get a better look.) Oh my God!",22
Ross," (answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Mon, how’s the packing

going? (Listens) Ben? He’s fine. Yeah, he’s right—Oh my God! (He looks over

at the fake Ben and notices that the head has fallen off.) Get your head of your shirt

there son! (He tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.) What? (Listens) Yeah,

it’s a pumpkin. I’ll come pack.",62
Joey," Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500

to him in Cups!",19
Joey," The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross

gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was

getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin’ Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn’t

even get half a cup! Nothin’!!",59
Joey," And he never played before either! Y’know what I think? I think

beginner’s luck, very important in Cups.",18
Joey," No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I’m serious this time!

In-in fact, look, there’s a—I wanna give you something. And let me give it too

you know before I pawn it for Cups money. (He rolls the big white dog over) Now, I want

you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y’know, thank you for being such a

great roommate.",68
Chandler, I can’t take the big white dog! You love it!,10
Chandler," No, but wait—what if I bought it from you, y’know? And your

nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (Gets choked up) $1,500?",29
Joey," Wait a second, I see what you’re trying to do here! You-you’re

trying to give me money again!",18
Joey," Over there! (Points to the couch) Before, with the bills! You tried to

give some charity, I said ""No,"" you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last

night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now

out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!",56
Chandler," I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that

you’re okay.",15
Joey," I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head

that I can’t take care of myself. Okay? Look, I’m not gonna miss you helping me

out with money. The only thing that I’m gonna miss…is you. And now the dog.",45
Rachel, Oh! I have your key. Here you go. (Hands it to Monica.),12
Rachel," Oh God! This is silly, I’m gonna see you in a couple of hours!

(They hug again.) ",17
Monica," What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog

sitting in the living room.)",17
Chandler, I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.,13
Ross," Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? (As he picks up the

fake Ben.)",18
Ross," I’m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.",13
Ross," Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I’d be glad to play

you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.",30
Chandler, Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.,13
Chandler," Hmm, let’s see if it comes up this time. (He looks at his cards

and shrugs.)",16
Phoebe," Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get

""it’s,"" ""and"" oh I'm sorry, I have ""A."" Forget it.",26
Rachel," No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.",14
Phoebe," Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you? 

This is gonna be interesting.",12
Rachel," Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running

before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!",24
Rachel," Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first

y’know roommate bonding thing.",18
Phoebe," All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's.

Please leave a message, thanks! ",17
Rachel, Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!,10
Ross," So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be

computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So

theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and

live forever as a machine.",46
Chandler, (not amused) And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.,13
Monica," (jumps over a box) Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the

floor!",15
Chandler," Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for

you. ",14
Joey," Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my

new roommate!",15
Joey," I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!",10
Joey, (shocked) From the land down under? I didn't know that either!,11
Joey," Oh, hey let me. (Opens the door for Janine and after he closes the door

behind her gasps ecstatically.)",19
Monica," Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?",14
Chandler," Oh, no-no-no. She's not my type. Not 

for me, she's not my type. She's too.....",15
Monica," Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate.

It-it'll be way too complicated. ",17
Ross," Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't

date her.",17
Chandler," (to Joey) Look, you know, what if you 

started going out with her and it didn't work out? ",18
Chandler," Now remember when you were going out with

that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped

into each other at the supermarket?",31
Joey," Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!",12
Monica," Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such

close quarters, it could be trouble.",19
Joey," Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an

attractive woman and not flirt.",21
Monica," (chuckles) Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.",13
Phoebe," I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.",13
Phoebe," Okay. (Starts running crazily with her arms flapping and her legs far

apart) Come on! That's not running! Let's go! (Rachel pauses, then follows, embarrassed.)",25
Rachel," You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between

Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.",23
Ross," Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every

night before she went to bed.",21
Monica," Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?",11
Rachel," Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just

don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.",29
Monica, Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.,12
Rachel," You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.",11
Rachel," Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!",13
Phoebe," But we were having so much fun. All 

those cute guys were checking us out. ",15
Monica, I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.,11
Chandler," OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. (Turns around

and sees that Joey isn't there.) Joe? (Hears giggling coming from a box) Well, I guess

Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack. (Hears the

giggling again)",46
Joey," Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks

great!",17
Chandler," Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica’s gonna be working

late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what

else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who

wouldn't wanna live with me?",49
Joey," (raises his hand) I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian

dancer.",14
Chandler," Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting

thing?",13
Joey," Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up

flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. (Gives Chandler the

""Joey-love,"" look.) How you doin?",36
Joey," No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need

to do my stretches too. (Starts to stretch, groans painfully)",23
Joey," Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all

sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. (Goes into the bathroom and comes back

out quickly) Oh my God!",34
Phoebe," (jumps in front of Rachel) Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab

your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.",31
Rachel," No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just

checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!",25
Ross," (enters) Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike.  ",11
Chandler," Look, I am working right now okay? So 

say what you have to say and leave me alone! ",18
Ross," Huh, sound alike too. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what ‘cha doin?",11
Chandler, What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!,10
Ross, Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?,11
Chandler, Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.,10
Chandler," Yes I'm gonna put it back (Mocking Ross) exactly where I found

it.",13
Chandler, She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.,15
Chandler," She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.",13
Ross," Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move

back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.",28
Chandler," I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.",10
Ross," Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right.

Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God,

she's going to sit on you. That probably won't hurt as 

much anymore. ",42
Chandler," No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right

now. (Picks up the phone and wipes it off) Phone's done ehh.",27
Monica," Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself.

Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight. ",26
Chandler," Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.",10
Monica," It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm

gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.",30
Chandler, No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.,11
Chandler," It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! (To Ross) She's-she's gonna kill me.",12
Ross," Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. (Chandler fixes it and a picture

frame off the table.) And that goes back up there.",24
Chandler," Okay this is good.  This is under 

control. We should start with the big stuff. Y’know? That'll be the

easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. (He picks up one end and Ross doesn't help) I got

it. (He moves it back to where he thinks it goes.)",48
Chandler," What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the

carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on

the...(Tries to rest his feet on the coffee table but they won't reach) OK, OK, here's

what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.",61
Ross," Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of

the carpet.",18
Chandler," OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.",13
Ross," Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the

seating area.",15
Joey," (entering) Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm

drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! (Tries to put his feet on the coffee

table...they won't reach and looks around.) What the hell's going on over here?!?!?

(Points to Chandler) Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do

something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all

the time. ",80
Joey," No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but

somehow you manage to kill it. (hits his other hand after 

each 'time') Time after time after time after time. What's your secret?",37
Ross," Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.",11
Chandler," Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we

went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not

stop talking about the Irish potato famine?",42
Ross," Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either.

After everything he said, he'd go ""ba dum bum chessh"" ",24
Chandler," Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.

",12
Ross," Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.",13
Joey," This is great, this is great, what else, what else?",10
Ross," Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.",10
Chandler, And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.,13
Ross, They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.,13
Rachel," Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?",10
Rachel," Okay, um, I...(Phoebe walks into her room.) All right Phoebe look, I

just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not

have lied to you. ",33
Rachel," Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because

um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...(Starts flapping her arms)",27
Rachel," Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.",12
Phoebe, But people that you don't know and will never see again.,11
Phoebe," Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss (panting). But no,

okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay.

You're uptight.",31
Rachel," I-I am not uptight—Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight,

man.",10
Phoebe," That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me.

I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's

fun. Y'know, I mean didn’t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall

off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from

Satan? (Rachel looks confused) The neighbor's dog.",72
Chandler," (blocks the door) No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here!

R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.",12
Chandler," (to Ross) I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too

see me naked.",16
Ross," Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.",10
Chandler," Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you

can come back later.",16
Monica," Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink

in the bathroom. Bye!",15
Chandler," Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything

back into its original place.",18
Ross," (realizes something) The photo album! There were millions of pictures of

the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the

pictures.",28
Chandler," That's perfect! That's brilliant! (Starts going through the photo

album)",10
Joey," Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.",13
Joey," All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're

hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and

it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.",40
Joey," No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and

you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?",25
Joey," Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right?

Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.",26
Joey," Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?",11
Rachel," Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!",11
Phoebe," See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second

cause then you're gone!",18
Rachel," Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. (Turns

and bumps into a mounted policeman and falls) Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry! (Runs

off.)",31
Chandler," No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room

got so much brighter when you came into it. (Forced laughter)",24
Monica," Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get

me started on the refrigerator magnets.",20
Chandler," Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I

wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved

everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very

sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",50
Monica," It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something? ",10
Monica," Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a

wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want

everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.",46
Chandler, Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.,10
Monica," All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. (Gets her cleaning gloves

on) Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?",23
Ross," So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out

the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download

our thoughts and our memories into this computer...",38
Ross," That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right

now? You and I, we're interfacing.",18
Monica," Okay, I'll do it, but as long as you 

promise you won't marry her. ",14
Chandler," Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I

remember when people used to use big lights.",21
Ross," Wow, Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did

someone get her drunk again or?",16
Monica," Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about.

It’s about being with the people that you love.",20
Chandler," I dunno what it is, it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas to

me.",14
Ross," … and that’s the story of the dreidel. Now, some people

trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into

their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolizing life’s triumph over death.

And that was like 4000 years ago.",48
Rachel," So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this

story.",13
Joey," I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the

place. Y’know, everywhere I look she’s like… (He imitates her stretching)",26
Monica," Aw, I’m sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way.",11
Joey," I know. And she’s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush

her hair.",16
Ross," I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot,

but now she’s like OLD NEWS!",21
Monica," Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark’s New Year’s

Rocking Eve?",12
Monica," Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it

since I can remember!",20
Chandler," Ah, you’re still just a little fat girl inside aren’t you?

(He kisses her on the cheek)",17
Ross, You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!,11
Joey, Totally! I would love to spend New Year’s with you.,10
Ross," Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times

Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a

lot of people know that.",38
Rachel," Well, I used to date him, but you’re still going out with her!",13
Monica," What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of

the millennium!",16
Rachel," Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I’m sorry,

but I don’t think that was a romantic thing.",21
Joey," Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a New

Year’s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back,

great! Y’know? But if she says ‘Dude, what the hell are you doing?’ I can

say ‘It wasn’t me, it was New Years!’",56
Rachel," Well, that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High

School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.",24
Monica, We are going to Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve!,10
Joey," OK, listen I’ve been on sets before, so let me give you a little

advice, alright? It’s a show, but we’re just dancing, OK? It’s no big deal.

The important thing to remember – stay cool.",36
Ross," Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?",10
Monica," You know what? We'd rather not dance 

together because..umm.see, we're brother and sister. ",13
Monica," As weird as coming all the way down here 

and then having to go home right now? ",17
Rachel," Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.",13
Phoebe," Yeah, Chandler why don’t you take a walk? This doesn’t concern

you.",12
Phoebe," No, yeah, we never find them! She’s always best at us that wily

minx.",14
Rachel," Don’t worry, we’re just gonna search here for an hour, them

we’re gonna go over to Joey’s and search, OK?",20
Chandler," No, you don’t have to, and you can’t because I live here

too.",13
Rachel," Chandler, aren’t you worried about what to get Monica for

Christmas?",11
Chandler," No, I have a great idea for a present for her.",11
Rachel," Chandler, that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great

present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten

her one great present? I mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do

that to her Chandler? Why? Why?",50
Rachel," (Reading) Dear losers, do you really think I’d hide

presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they’d break you.",20
Chandler," Y’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and

look, you don’t, you don’t do that every year do you?",24
Chandler," You don’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my

gym bag or anything?",18
Chandler," Because that’s where Joey gave me some stuff to store that

I’ve never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! (He does a weird

clicky motion with his fingers, that kinda hard to describe.)",38
Monica," If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those

platforms. They’ve been taping those people up there all day.",27
Ross," Hey, what’d you guys do to get up on there?",10
Monica," Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on

underpants?",17
Joey," No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and

I think I have a shot.",21
Rachel," Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some

coats.",14
Phoebe," Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!",12
Rachel," Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?",11
Chandler," Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?",12
Rachel," Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of

you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!",30
Joey," Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. (The girl starts

dancing really close to him, so he picks her up, twirls her round, and puts her against a

platform) Here we go. (He walks away to find Monica and Ross doing a really out of place

dance) Looking good Gellers!",54
Monica," Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He’s the one who decides who

gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.",24
Monica," Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren’t wearing underpants?",11
Ross," Monica! (Pause) Would it? (The director shakes his head.)

How about me? (The director shakes his head again.)",18
Joey," Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that

you’re dancing with.",18
Joey," Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this

plan to kiss her at the new years countdown – I’m trying to win her over, so I

was wondering if..",36
Joey," Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she’s real, uh,

mellow!",14
Joey," Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know…",12
Joey," Alright, alright, hey y’know fair is fair, (he pretends to wash his

hands) if you’re right, you’re right, what can I say, but hey oh no! (He throws

water on the guy’s pants)",33
Joey," Hey, now you’re the one who wet his pants. (He throws another handful

on him and runs out)",18
Rachel," You guys, I'm telling you. Monica would 

not hide the presents down here.",13
Chandler," No, but she did. Look, there's that 

old hippie I've always wanted. (Points to an old hippie man.)",18
Rachel," Well, you know what? If they are here, 

Gunther knows about it. ",12
Phoebe," Oh, and I could get it out of him. He's 

had a huge crush on me. ",16
Phoebe,"  No-no! That's not fair to play 

with his head, though. No, you do it Rachel.",15
Rachel," Okay.  (walks over to Gunther and 

sits down) Hey Gunther. (puts her hand over his hand) Hi. (And she starts 

rubbing his hand.) Getting to be that holiday time again huh? ",31
Rachel," And you know, I was thinking, you know 

since it's the time of giving gifts, (starts stroking her finger on Gunther's 

hand for a second.)  I was wondering, are there any presents around here 

for me? You know what I mean? ",41
Phoebe," Hey, I think I've found them. (She is 

standing next to a bin of toys.)",15
Monica," Man, this sucks! Y’know if Mom and Dad don’t see us on TV

after we made them so jealous, I mean, who’s gonna be the losers then?",27
Ross," Hey, I know what’ll get us up on a platform!",10
Ross," Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he’ll wanna build

us our own platform!",15
Ross," We got honorable mention in the brother/sister dance category!

Look, it’s almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?",21
Monica," Okay, let’s do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!",12
Ross," So, do we really have to ask who’s going up on the platform

next?",14
Joey," Uh, take a look at the guy’s pants! I mean, I know you told us to

show excitement, but don’t you think he went a little overboard?",27
Ross," Can you believe this? We’re gonna be on the platform for the

Millennium moment!",14
Monica," I know! Hey, you haven’t been practicing the routine, have you?",11
Ross," Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe 

going

into the robot, y’know? (He mimics a robot)",21
Monica," Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don’t wanna look

stupid!",14
Ross," Uh, I think he's kicking out anyone who's 

not dancing. So just keep dancing. (They both uncover their ears and start 

dancing even more oddly.) ",25
Phoebe," Y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought

maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.",23
Chandler," Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.",10
Phoebe," Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? No!

Didn’t think so! Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!",24
Chandler," Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder

what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?",24
Rachel," This bench, it’s hollow! I can’t believe I never knew that!

(She pushes all the pillows off it and opens it up) Oh, the presents!!!",25
Chandler," I don’t wanna know what Monica got me. Y’know? I mean, look,

I’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me,

and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what

Christmas is about.",51
Chandler," Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don’t know about you guys,

but I wanna see the look on Monica’s face when I give her my present, and I’m

sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just,

can we put them back?",54
Monica," Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the

presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?",28
Phoebe," Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.",11
Joey," Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how

the New Year’s gonna go off. I guess there’s no reason for all that Y2K panic,

y’know? Anyway, g’night!",34
Joey," Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.",14
Joey, But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?,11
Joey," Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to

get ready.",17
Monica," We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new

Millennium, and the guy yelled ‘CUT!’",19
Rachel," Wow, so then I guess that mean that you 

guys are still tied. ",13
Ross," Oh, I don't know about that. I think she 

saw us do our routine. Yeah, I may have boogied right into first place. ",23
Rachel," Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from

eighth grade?",16
Monica," Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. (To Ross) Hey, by

the way, great thinking about catching me!",23
Rachel," ‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done the

end the way you guys did it back then!",21
Ross," I don’t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger

back then.",15
Monica," I can do it, okay? Come on, let’s go. (She and Ross get up)",14
Monica, I can’t do it! (Ross falls into Monica’s guest room),10
Joey," Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?",11
Phoebe," She’s made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.",11
Joey," Well all right then, I guess I shouldn’t get to excited about the

fact (excitedly) that I just kissed her!",20
Ross," So you ended up with Janine. Well, 

congratulations you won fair and square. ",13
Rachel," Yeah, it was real neck and neck there 

for a while.",11
Joey," Okay, I’m all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?

(She kisses him on the cheek and starts to leave.)",23
Joey," Have you kissed her yet? It’s awesome! I could do it forever!

Y’know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!",21
Joey," Look, it's like imagine your best kiss 

ever. (They start thinking about it.) Right? Okay, now multiply that, by, like 

10. (They start to have bigger smiles on their faces.) Huh? (To Rachel) No, no 

wait a second you dated Ross. (To Monica) And you date Chandler. Okay, multiply 

it by, like, 50.",53
Chandler," (entering) Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the

post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.

(Hands her all of her bills and stuff.)",35
Rachel," Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! (Grabs the aforementioned catalog and holds

the rest back out to Chandler.) You can throw the rest away.",21
Rachel," Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. (Shows

her the picture.)",14
Rachel," Yeah! It’s an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an

apothecary is?",13
Joey," I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I

sat on a bed!",18
Chandler, You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!,10
Monica," Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should

have a history, a story behind it.",19
Rachel," Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way

from the White Plains store.",21
Monica," It’s gotta be one of a kind. Y’know like umm, y’know uh,

what’s that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?",24
Joey, Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.,13
Monica," I’m telling—If you put that in her apartment you’ll never

hear the end of it.",15
Rachel," Okay fine! I’ll-I’ll just tell her it’s an antique

apothecary table, she doesn’t have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this

little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.",35
Chandler," …so then the farmer says, ""That’s not a cow and

you’re not milking it."" (Everyone laughs.) ",16
Monica," I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking

for a couple to go out with and now we have one!",26
Joey," And Chandler I can’t believe I let you pay for this one. (They hug

and he whispers in his ear.) Thanks man.",22
Monica," So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I’ll make that pasta thing

I was telling you about.",18
Joey," Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.",11
Joey," Nope-op! I insist! (He hugs Chandler again and whispers to him.) You get

the wine right?",16
Joey," Uh, they’re like my best friends. Are you saying we can’t hang

out with them? ‘Cause that would kinda be a problem.",22
Joey," If you want, I’ll sell my friends and use the money to buy you

presents.",15
Phoebe," (sees the table) Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?",13
Rachel," Ha! See, I knew, I knew you’d get it on the first guess. Isn’t

it cool! It’s an apothecary table.",20
Phoebe," Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where (She’s opening and

closing the drawers) they kept all the stuff to make their potions.",25
Rachel," Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was

new, y’know like back then.",21
Rachel," Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y’know, it was

like a dollar.",19
Rachel, And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.,10
Rachel," Uh, it’s from yore. Like the days of yore. Y’know?",10
Phoebe," Yes, yes I do. God, oh it’s just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great

story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y’know where it was from

or…",32
Phoebe," (gasps) White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.",11
Rachel," Ross! Phoebe’s gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!",11
Ross," Well why not?! She’ll-she’ll love it! It’s the real thing!

I got it at Pottery Barn.",16
Rachel," I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table

she’s gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.",30
Rachel," I know! I know, she says it’s all mass-produced, nothing is

authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. (Ross looks at his table.) So come

on, she’s gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?!

Please?",44
Ross," What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe—Ooh, although I did

get some great Pottery Barn sheets! (Gets them.)",22
Ross," Uh, yeah! I still can’t believe she hates Pottery Barn!",10
Rachel," Ross, get over it! It’s not like she hates you.",10
Ross," Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y’know what I think? It’s just

she-she’s weird. Y’know it’s because she’s a twin. Twins are weird.",21
Rachel," Ross, she’s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a

kind.",15
Ross, Huh. Y’know what’s not one of a kind? A twin!,10
Rachel," Ooh, Phoebe’s here! Okay, let’s turn out all the lights and

we’ll just watch the movie!",16
Phoebe," Okay. Hey—Ooh, cool sheets! (Notices the sheet over the table.) ",10
Ross," Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it? ",11
Phoebe," You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen

the purse strings a little.",19
Monica, The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.,12
Chandler," And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (Hands

it to him.) You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn’t afford it,

because you paid dinner last night.",36
Joey," Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it’s just gonna be me again tonight.",12
Joey," Yeah, she’s been in there all day (Points to her room), uh high

fever, a nose problem… Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!",20
Joey," Uh, y’know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.",12
Joey," Well uh, she didn’t want to hang out with you guys two nights in a

row. I’m so sorry.",19
Chandler," Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!",11
Joey," Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are

too loud.",16
Chandler," So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was

lying to our faces?!",18
Monica," Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could

not have been nicer to her!",22
Joey," I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don’t-don’t be

mad. I’m sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys

are like my best friends! Y’know? And it was our first date! Plus, she’s really

sick!",44
Joey," I know, but don’t you think the sick thing is way better than the

play thing?",16
Chandler," Eh, they’re both good. I generally just go with, Monica’s

drunk again. (Monica glares at him.) ",16
Joey," Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh?

She’ll come around I promise.",18
Monica," Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.",10
Rachel, That’s funny. (Phoebe puts her feet up on Ross’s table.),10
Ross," Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new…(On

Rachel’s glare)…old sheet?",16
Phoebe," Oh sure! (She goes to take her feet off, but drags the sheet with her

which spills the wine.) Noo!",20
Rachel," Noooooo!! (Phoebe lifts up the sheet to discover the exact same

apothecary table they have.) ",15
Rachel," Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our

antique!",14
Phoebe," Wow! Oh my God, well if they’ve ripped off our table ours must be

much more than one and fifty dollars!",21
Ross," Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for

wrecking my sheet by the way.",19
Phoebe," Oh Ross, calm down, I’ll give you the 80 cents. (Ross glares at

Rachel)",14
Joey," Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I

came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.",29
Monica," Well, I’d like to but, (extremely quietly) I’m not sure we

have time to go.",15
Joey," Ha-ha, very funny—Look! I don’t know what to do! I really want

you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!",30
Joey," That’s right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your

relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like

an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!",42
Monica," We didn’t give you any money! (Chandler is motioning,

""No!"")",10
Rachel," …see I can’t decide whether it would go better next to the new

wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.",24
Ross, Wow! I didn’t know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.,12
Ross," A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that!

The ornamental bird cage! Large!",20
Phoebe," (sees Ross) Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early

Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.",25
Phoebe, (gasps) Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!,14
Rachel," Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial

times.",14
Ross," Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other

time periods Rachel? (She glares at him.)",22
Phoebe," Yeah no, I’m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this

stuff. Ross, y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate—And I think that

you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.",37
Phoebe," Oh, come on! I think he’s ready to get rid of, what did you call

it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.",22
Ross," Really?! (To Rachel) Hey, y’know what? Since you have such a great

sense of what I need, uh ooh, here’s-here’s 60 bucks, why don’t you take

Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.",40
Rachel," (not sure of what to do) Y’know what? I don’t, I don’t

think Phoebe really wants to come.",18
Phoebe," Yeah! I'm gonna get my purse. (Runs to 

her room.)",10
Ross," Okay. Hey, hey, can I have all this stuff 

when she makes you throw it out? ",16
Rachel," Well, sure, and I'll show you were you 

can put it. ",11
Rachel," Pheebs, I don’t know what to say. I guess the flea market was just

better last time.",17
Rachel," Yeah, y’know what? Don’t look at it. (Realizes the display is

their living room) Seriously, don’t look at it. (Tries to pull Phoebe away.)",24
Phoebe, No! Look-look! There’s the coffee table they stole from us!,10
Phoebe," That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the…wait a

sec! This is our exact living room!",19
Rachel," No! No! No! No it’s not! No it’s not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is

totally different! I mean we don’t have the… (Looks desperately for something

different.) We don’t have the…that lamp! And-and that screen is y’know, on

the other side.",41
Phoebe," Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh

my God!",16
Rachel," Okay! Okay-okay look—no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know

how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just… Come on don’t be mad.",25
Phoebe," No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that

is wrong with the world! And it’s all sitting up in my living room and all I can

think about is how I don’t have that lamp!",41
Rachel," Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.",14
Phoebe," I can’t! I can’t! Unless… Well are you saying that-that

you would move out if-if I didn’t buy that lamp?",20
Phoebe," But are you saying that you would move out if I didn’t buy that

lamp?",15
Phoebe, Okay then I don’t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!,13
Joey," Well, this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time?",10
Monica," (bursting in) I knew it!! Y’know, you’re not so quiet

yourself, missy!",12
Chandler," And I’m blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching

modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (Imitating her) ""Oh Chandler,

I just lost myself in the moment.""",33
Monica," (steps up and points at her) All right! You and me! Let’s go! Right

now!",15
Joey," All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! (To Chandler and

Monica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.)",25
Monica," (to Janine) You’d better hope I don’t see you in the hallway!!

(They exit.)",14
Joey," All right, uh, we’ve got a little bit of a problem here. These people

are my friends; you can’t treat them that way.",23
Joey," I know! I know! And I’m going to talk to them about it. They mean so

much to me. They… They’re like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all

the time, I-I… I don’t think we can be together. It just, it just can’t

work. It can’t. (Starts to break up) I’m very upset.",57
Joey," Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. (He opens the door for her

and she exits into the hallway.)",20
Monica," Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.",14
Monica," Now come on. (They hug like men.) Well, I’m glad we worked things

out.",14
Monica," (hearing that) That’s it big girl! (Hits Janine in the butt with

the garbage bag) Come on!",17
Chandler," (to Monica) You know, I'm not sure you 

could have taken Janine. ",12
Monica," Are you kidding me?! I know what to do 

with tall girls. You go for their knees! ",17
Monica, I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.,11
Ross," I’m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think

you should come.",14
Ross, Hey. Check this out.  you’re not going to believe this. ,10
Chandler," Yes, Ross, we know they have magazines 

with pictures of naked women in them. ",14
Rachel," (quietly) Don't tell him about the 

videos! (Chandler waves his hand as a sign.)",14
Ross," I made up a joke and sent it

in to Playboy. They printed it!",14
Ross," Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It’s not

just about the pictures.",13
Monica," That didn’t work on mom, it’s not going to work on us.",12
Ross," (showing them the page) Here, check it out. It’s the first

one, too.",13
Chandler, That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.,12
Chandler," Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest

joke he’d ever heard.",21
Rachel," I’m sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is

funny. (Ross grabs the magazine away from her.)",22
Ross," Look, Chandler, it’s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any

better they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit,

right?",28
Chandler," (jumping up from his chair) Hey, Joey, Playboy

printed my joke.",11
Ross," No, it’s my joke, it’s mine. You can call them, they’ll

tell you.",13
Joey," Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there,

right?",12
Chandler," Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart

is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.",26
Chandler," Nah, Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don’t

want to miss when they were skinny.",17
Joey," Chandler, Chandler, y’know what we should do? You and I should go out

and get some new sunglasses.",18
Chandler," What? No, I want to watch this. (He turns on the television and the

screen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable go out?",25
Joey," No, that’s VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen

to today . . . It’s like a lotta noise to me. I don’t know…",27
Joey," I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill",11
Chandler," If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some

money?",14
Joey," No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a

little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot. ",24
Joey," I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to

the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book (holds up the Playboy magazine).",31
Chandler," (picks up the phone) All right, you want to see if the joke stealer

will let us watch the show at his place?",23
Chandler," (with phone to ear, obviously hearing no dial tone) Paid your phone

bill?",13
Phoebe," Oh, I want to look too! (She runs over and sits down and checks out a

picture). Yikes!",18
Monica," So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell a

story?",14
Rachel," Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has

lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where are

they, where are they?’",34
Monica," Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.",13
Phoebe," Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn,

lift up your shirt, and bend over?",22
Rachel," You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’s

outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come in

handy",30
Monica," Okay, I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date,

who would it be?",19
Ross," You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.",14
Chandler," So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.",14
Joey," Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but

I’m not even sure I got it.",22
Ross," What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.",10
Chandler," (stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.",13
Ross," Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why

he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.",21
Chandler," So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.",10
Ross," Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show

the sexy teller that I am a published writer.",25
Chandler," Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.",11
Ross," Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?",11
Ross," Well, I’m not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).",13
Joey," Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not

working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff.",27
Joey," Uh, I don’t know. Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a

soap opera y’know? And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to

wait on all my friends.",36
Joey, Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?,11
Monica," (visibly upset) She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it,

but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.",21
Monica, It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.,11
Chandler," You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross

did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know?

And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.",42
Monica," That’s right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hear

something?",13
Chandler," Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing

my thoughts.",14
Joey," (sheepishly) I finished my book. (Chandler and Monica slowly retreat back

to bed.)",13
Monica," (laughing) Oh, don’t you guys look cute. You guys make

such a cute couple.",14
Monica," (laughing harder) Nothing, I’m just trying to recreate

some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. (To Phoebe) Remember, when you

picked Rachel over me? That was funny.",33
Monica," (angrily) It wasn’t funny at all! Why would you do that?

Why didn’t you pick me?",16
Phoebe," Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than

you is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance—Okay

let’s go to lunch!",29
Monica," That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay,

prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!",29
Phoebe," No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just

not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s

all.",21
Phoebe," Ya, you know, Rachel … she’ll do whatever you want.

Y’know, you can just walk all over her.",18
Rachel," What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I’m a pushover?

I’m not a pushover.",16
Rachel," Oh my … you think I’m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you

know what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think

that’s pretty strong, that’s what I think. Come on, Monica, let’s go to

lunch. (She leaves)",44
Monica," (to Phoebe) You start working on that list. (She grabs her

coat and leaves, too.)",15
Ross," (showing the Playboy magazine to Gunther) Oh, hey, Gunther, check this

out.",12
Joey," Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m heading

up there.",13
Joey, Sure. (To Monica and Rachel) Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there. ,11
Joey," (to a table of strangers) You guys need anything, ‘cause I’m

heading up there. ",14
Joey," Just being friendly. (He gives Monica a ‘what’s wrong with

you?’ look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)",19
Rachel," Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.",11
Joey," Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther? (Winks at him as if they’re in

on a secret together.)",16
Joey," Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on

aprons. ",15
Monica," Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?",12
Joey," It’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. I mean, I was an actor and

now I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction.",24
Chandler, So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.,10
Joey," I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guess

I’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I

just feel kind of weird serving you guys.",39
Rachel," Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.",10
Ross," Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?",13
Ross," Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it.",11
Rachel," Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass

on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the

coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. (Joey nods.) A smile goes a long

way. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.",62
Joey," Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now, how

about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover.",27
Joey," Oh, I’m sorry, Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since I

made you wait, I’ll toss in a free muffin.",23
Rachel, Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.,11
Monica," So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little

bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?",26
Rachel," Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.",14
Rachel," So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky?",10
Joey," Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.",15
Joey," Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it’s a great part.

Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in this

bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’",41
Joey," Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat is

taken.’",14
Joey," No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?",11
Joey," Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be

closed for about an hour. ",17
Joey," Yeah, it’s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It’s a very

important issue in this month’s Playboy. I’m sure you all read about it.

(A man just decides to sit there.) Hey! Don't you wanna 

keep guns away from kids? ",43
Joey," It's a vicious cycle. Get out! (The 

customer gets up and starts to leave.) Go! (Customer exits.) ",17
Chandler," Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.",12
Ross," Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most

important thing in the world.",15
Chandler," (to Ross) Don’t try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) I’m

your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let’s go.",21
Ross," We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide

which one of us is telling the truth—me. ",23
Chandler," Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.",13
Monica," Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?",10
Chandler," So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve’s

doctor’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is how

the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his

point.)",45
Ross," Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution?

Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!",25
Monica," You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive to

women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you

should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!

Now let it go! The joke sucks! ",49
Monica," Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them what

you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?",23
Chandler," (starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient,

together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be

perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and—(He falters and

Monica prompts him.)—generosity of spirit.",44
Rachel," Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve ever

heard.",15
Monica," Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.",11
Chandler," (To Chandler) I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing

again?",14
Monica," Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!",10
Chandler," (pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) You’re a little

high maintenance.",15
Chandler," I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’re

passionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think

that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good

too. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I

like … maintaining you.",54
Monica," (embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didn’t even tell him to say

that. (They hug). All right you’re off my list. ",21
Monica," (sits next to him) Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to

be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.",22
Joey," Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so

…",16
Joey," Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in

charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.",34
Rachel," He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left

you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’s

not right.",31
Rachel," Joey, you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I’m

not going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him—No, I

really shouldn’t say anything—No, I should say something to him. (Goes to the

counter) Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you

have to fire him…",65
Rachel," That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that

all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.",25
Phoebe," Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.",15
Rachel," Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the

other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?",27
Chandler," Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. I’m not answering

that. ",14
Joey," Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75.

Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together

that’s (pauses to figure the total) $12.75.",32
Chandler," This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phone

bill in half.",15
Joey," Well, he’s not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I

good check with him—He says it’s okay. (She hands him her card.) Great! Thanks!

Bye-bye!",29
Joey," It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great!

I’m getting more dates than ever!",21
Rachel," Wait a minute, you’re only giving free stuff away to the pretty

girls?",13
Phoebe," Oh I do! (She grabs her huge purse and starts rummaging through it and

taking out various items in a futile search for the gum.) Oh, y’know what? No.

(Pause) Wait a second. (She removes a bag filled with water that has a goldfish swimming

in it.) I know it’s in here somewhere.",53
Phoebe," All right. Sorry, I guess it's in my big 

bag. ",10
Chandler," Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at work?",11
Monica," (congested) Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can’t work if

I’m sick.",14
Monica," I’m not sick!! I don’t get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings

and for pansies! ",15
Rachel," Honey, no one thinks you’re a pansy, but we do think you need a

tissue. (She notices something hanging from Monica’s nose, as does Joey.)",25
Monica, (wiping her nose) I have not been sick in over three years! (Sneezes.) ,13
Chandler," I think you're sick because that 

(points to the ground) used to be in your nose. I’m gonna grab you some tissue.",22
Ross," When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re

not fine.",13
Monica," I’m fine-d. I’m fine-d! Y’know, it’s a really hard

word to say.",12
Rachel," Don’t!! (Joey backs away frightened.) (To Jill) Honey, what are you

doing here?!",13
Phoebe," (To Ross) Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or

that’s bitter?",14
Rachel," Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad’s proud of me! My dad’s proud

of me.",15
Rachel," Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you

off?",16
Chandler," Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! (Rachel glares

at him.)",13
Ross," Oh yes, good criers, the Green girls. 

(Rachel and Jill glare at him.) I mean-I mean the Green sisters. (They are still 

glaring.) Man, no matter how you say it, it still sounds like you're talking 

about green people. I'm at rock bottom.  ",43
Rachel," Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could’ve ever

happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did

it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I’m the only daughter dad is

proud of!  ",52
Rachel," Well maybe, you just uh..you won't buy 

stuff for a while. ",11
Rachel," Okay, well this is, this is what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna get a

job, you’re gonna get an apartment, and then you will 

live off the money that you earn. ",31
Rachel," Okay, but it can be. It can be you, and then I’ll help you and you can stay with

us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?",27
Joey," Well if it’s free food, how come you’re charging me for it?",12
Joey," Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?",11
Joey," (to a woman who came in third in a modeling contest) Sorry! (He grabs her

muffin away and returns it to the serving tray.)",24
Ross," Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your

credit card.",17
Ross," I don’t think charging new clothes to your dad qualifies as making

it on your own.",16
Phoebe," Seriously, I don’t Rachel’s gonna think it’s a good idea.",10
Rachel," You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it

right under Jill’s nose when you know she’s trying to quit. Wow, you guys are

terrible!",30
Phoebe," Oh well, all right, I got (Ross hands her a bag) (To Ross) thank you, I

got uh, this y’know ""I want a job sweater."" (Holds up the same sweater.)",30
Phoebe," And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.",10
Rachel," No, of course, of course I’ve heard of them! Ross, what did you

get?",14
Ross," Huh? Oh, I got this—(Holds up this pink frilly thing)—this!",10
Rachel," Oh, come on! You think that’s gonna work on me?! I invented that!",13
Rachel," All right, it’s okay. One little setback is okay, just don’t

let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should

take it all away. But I’m just gonna take the-the pashmina. (Ross hands it to her.)

And the uh, and the uh pants. Y’know what, I’m just gonna take it all away,

‘cause that way you’ll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I’m

gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. (Leaves with all of

Jill’s stuff.)",91
Ross," Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one. (Holds it up for her.)",12
Ross," Oh yeah, how about you and the, (mimics her fake cry) ""I’m

sorry!""",13
Phoebe," What about, what about when I said y’know about the apartment

pants, how dumb was I?",16
Phoebe," (gets up and sits between them) Okay-okay, why don’t I sit here and

you’ll both stop it!",17
Monica," Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let’s do something

crazy!",15
Chandler," I know, let’s rest and drink lots of fluids. (Holds up a glass of

orange juice.)",16
Monica," Okay, I’ll rest. But y’know if I’m going to bed, then

you’re coming with me.",15
Chandler," That would be impossible to resist if you weren’t all drippy

here. (Points to his nose.)",16
Monica," (wiping her nose) Are you saying that you don’t wanna get with

this? (Tries to do a little sexy body rub, but it doesn’t work all that well with the

big robe.)",32
Chandler," Yeah, I don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy.",11
Chandler," Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I just

can’t have sex with a sick person.",17
Monica," I’m with you Chandler! I mean I can’t have sex with a sick

person either, that’s disgusting! But I’m not sick! Let me prove it to you. We

are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.",37
Chandler," That’s the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of

mwha-ah-libe.",14
Rachel," Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants, because I just

pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.",25
Phoebe," No. No. It’s just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you

left and umm, I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.",28
Phoebe," Yeah I mean it’s probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you

that there might be something there.",19
Rachel," Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don’t really like it

when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn’t that like incest or something?!

Oh my God, and they’re gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this

is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t—I

don’t own Ross! Y’know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that

she wants to do! And oh my God, I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister,

this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to

me.",114
Joey," It’s just I can’t because my manager said I… (Gets an idea)

(Starts singing) ""Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear

Annie…",26
Rachel," (on the couch) Oh hi! Y’know, I just wanted to see if there were

any leads on the old job front.",21
Rachel," That is great. Hey, y’know who doesn’t have to job hunt? Ross.

He works at the university. ",17
Rachel," Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so

you think you’re gonna go out?",21
Rachel," I just, Phoebe, said y’know thought she saw something between you

guys.",12
Rachel," Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there

something wrong with Ross?",18
Rachel," What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those

things aren’t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!",30
Rachel," Yeah but, you don’t, you don’t, you don’t want to try to

much too fast. Y’know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that

tried to much too fast don’t you?",35
Chandler," Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? (He gets up from

the couch and goes into the bedroom to find Monica, still in the robe, lying seductively

on the bed. Or at least she’s trying too and as he enters the room, she takes the

robe off on of her legs.) Oh-ohhhh!",56
Monica," (trying to be seductive) Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.",12
Chandler," Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.",10
Monica, How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.,13
Chandler," I was asleep. (She takes off her robe and starts to shiver) Oh no!

No-no honey! Y’know what’s sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy.

And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.",34
Monica," Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I’m not sick! I

wanna make you feel, as good as I feel. (Sneezes.) ",26
Monica," I’m fine. (She goes into one of those half sneezing, half-coughing

fits that you get with a bad cold or flu.) ",21
Monica," No, I'm not. No, I'm not, I'm laughing. 

(Tries to start laughing but ends up coughing again.) ",17
Monica," No, I don't want it to spoil... the 

mood. (Moves closer to Chandler and sneezes on Chandler's face.) ",18
Ross," Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she’s cute but I-I would

never have thought of going out with her, never!",23
Ross," Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, ""Why not?!""",12
Ross," I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all

we’ve been through, I just—y’know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.

Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.",44
Monica," Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my

chest? (She hands him some of that Vicks Vap-O-Rub to put on.)",27
Monica, Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?,11
Monica, I can’t believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?,14
Chandler," It’s all very, very good. (She covers up and sits down.) So you

wanna go uh, mix it up?",19
Monica, What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?,11
Ross, Hi (sees Rachel and forgets her name for a moment).,10
Rachel," Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it’s not!",15
Ross," Okay. So well I’ll umm, (To Rachel) I’ll have her home by

midnight.",13
Rachel," Uh, I’m just, I’m just looking out your window. At-at the

view. What are you guys doing?",17
Monica," (entering with Chandler) Who? (She looks out the window at Ross’s

apartment) Is that your sister?",16
Monica," God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!",13
Monica," Oh no it’s not, no it’s not. It’s a first date. I’m sure

that nothing is gonna…(as she is talking we see Ross close his drapes.)",26
Chandler," Ho-oh, he’s gonna get some! (Rachel looks at him.) Of the glare

from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y’know so umm, he’s closed the drapes

there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. (Pause) Well,

I’m off to bed! (Goes to bed.)",48
Monica," (cleared up a bit) You better not get me 

sick. ",10
Chandler," (gets up to go the kitchen) Uhh. I 

need some fruit or some juice or some....(opens the refrigerator to find there 

is barely anything in it) Or some nothing.  There's nothing in here. Who 

took our food? ",37
Joey," Can I interest you in a slice of lasagna 

or a drumstick? ",12
Joey," (to himself) Ehh, what are you gonna do. 

(Takes a bite of the drumstick.) ",14
Joey," (sees Rachel) Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to

uh… Oh wait, I don’t have to lie to you, you don’t live here anymore. Uh,

I’m eating their food. What are you doing?",39
Rachel," Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and

a-half-hours ago.",17
Rachel," Yeah. And y’know who should’ve shut their drapes? Is that

perverted old couple two doors over.",16
Joey," I can’t believe Ross went out with Rachel’s sister! When

Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.",24
Rachel," Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!",10
Rachel," (to Gunther) I’ll take a coffee. (To Ross) So how was your big date

last night?",16
Rachel," Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?",12
Rachel," So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut

the drapes!",15
Ross," No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my

favorite fossils.",17
Ross," Something could’ve happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides.

And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.",18
Rachel," Right. Was it the, ""Please don’t show me another picture of a

trilobite vibe?""",14
Ross," I'm telling you, she was into me, okay! 

(realizes something) Hey, you remembered trilobite. (Starts to become excited 

but Rachel doesn't care.) Anyway, if she, if she wasn’t in to me, why-why would she ask me out

again?",38
Ross," Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine’s Day, the most romantic day

of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my

slides, if you know what I mean.",35
Rachel," Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I

can’t! I can’t! I can’t! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I

just can’t. It’s just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together

and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can’t do it! I can’t do it.",58
Ross," (while Rachel is finishing her rant) Okay! Okay! Okay! It’s okay.

(Rachel stops.) It’s okay. Hey, it’s too weird for you, I won’t see her

again.",26
Rachel," No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can’t! I can’t do it!

(Starts to freak out.) It’s just gonna freak me out!!!",20
Ross," Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I’ll-I’ll tell

her tonight I can’t see her anymore.",15
Rachel," Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that’s-that’s

crazy—I mean that’s crazy. So what’s-what’s going on with you? What is

going on with you?",26
Ross," Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!",11
Joey," I don't know what you guys are so sad 

about. It all works out. E.T. stays with Elliott, and they get to hang out and 

be best friends, like, forever.",30
Chandler," Joey, you've seen this movie before. 

E.T. goes back home. ",10
Joey," What? (realizes) Oh no I forgot. (Starts 

to cry and grabs a tissue.)",13
Phoebe," Oh y’know what’s sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for

three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself

so I was partly crying for that.",34
Chandler," (totally not crying) Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi

is a cartoon!",17
Chandler," Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!

Look, if this movie's making you guys cry so much, let's 

just change the channel.",27
Chandler," Okay. (Picks up the remote and changes 

the channel where some rock hard music is playing.) There.",17
Joey," (crying) I was up for that part. (points 

at the T.V.)",11
Monica," Chandler there’s nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don’t

have to be so macho all the time.",18
Monica, Yeah you’re right. I don’t know what I was thinking.,10
Chandler," No, I guess I just never really cried. Y’know? I’m not a

crying kind of guy.",16
Joey," Come on man there’s gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like

uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?",23
Joey," Okay, what if the puppy said, ""Help me Chandler. All the other

puppies pick on me.""",16
Monica," Oh, I’ve got it! I have got it! (Gets up and gets something from

the dresser underneath the TV.) Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going

good!",29
Phoebe," All right, what’s going on there? (Points to a picture.)",10
Chandler," Oh, that’s Parent’s Day, first grade. That’s me with

the janitor Martin.",12
Chandler," No! Look, I don’t cry! It’s not a big deal! Okay?!",11
Joey," No! It’s not okay! It’s not okay at all!! You’re dead

inside!!",12
Phoebe," Oh you’re my biggest fan? I’ve always wanted to meet you! Hi!

(Shakes his hand.) Sure! Yeah! (Signs the autograph)",20
Phoebe," You’re just saying that because you’re my biggest fan. (The

fan leaves and Joey approaches.) (To Joey) Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay?

(Points) He’s a fan. (To the fan as she’s leaving) Bye! (Exits)",38
Joey," (to the fan) So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to,

want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?",27
Joey," Hey Gunther, don’t let that guy in here anymore! He just said

Phoebe’s a porn star!",16
Rachel," Ohhh well. Y’know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a

guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work

named Bob! He’s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.",41
Rachel," No-no-no. No-no-no, that would never 

have worked on Ross. But you know who that might work on? Bob in Human 

Resources. ",21
Rachel," No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because

I asked him to.",17
Rachel, Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history…,13
Rachel," Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross!

There’s a million other guys out there, you just…",23
Rachel," I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to

do!",15
Rachel," Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being

a brat! Wanting what you can’t have!",22
Rachel," All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!",13
Rachel," …I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess

Caroline?!",15
Monica, (noticing the bag Joey’s carrying) Oh great! Did you get a movie?,12
Joey," Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don’t think it’s the kind

you’re gonna like.",14
Chandler," You didn’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for

the tissues all night did you?",18
Joey, Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.,10
Ross," And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of

him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn’t know he was in there. (They

all kinda look at him.)",40
Rachel," Wow! I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this.

Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been

somewhat of a question mark.",29
Monica," This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y’know she

had such a terrible childhood.",18
Chandler," Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don’t do porn.",11
Monica," (hands the tape back to Joey, but doesn’t let him grab it)

Y’know maybe a little bit!",17
Joey," No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe’s our friend! Well,

I’m not gonna watch it!",17
Monica, Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?,10
Rachel," Well it’s hard to tell… (Rachel gets up to get a closer look,

only she’s having some trouble.) Oh God, if she would just stop moving.",26
Joey, (sitting at the kitchen table with his back to the TV) You sick bastards!,14
Rachel," Oh, it’s a tattoo! That’s weird, Phoebe doesn’t…

Wait that’s Ursula! That’s not Phoebe that is Ursula!",17
Joey, Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!,11
Phoebe," (entering) Hey! What’s up? (Sees the TV) Oh my God! What am I

doing?!!",14
Chandler," Hey! (He quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under the

couch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)",26
Monica, Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.,11
Chandler," Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y’know? Maybe one of those

stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all dead

inside.",29
Monica," Oh that’s so sweet! Look Chandler I don’t care if you

can’t cry, I love you.",16
Chandler, Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.,12
Chandler," No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married,

we’re up at the altar and I’m like this. (Makes a bored face.)",25
Monica," I won’t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.

(Points to her heart.)",18
Monica," Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to

you in the delivery room and you don’t cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him

to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing,

it won’t matter to me.",56
Chandler," Okay, well I won’t uh, worry about this anymore then.",10
Monica," And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you’re writing out

my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, ""I will

always be with you,"" and you still can’t shed one tiny tear, I know you’ll

be crying a river inside.",51
Monica," What?! You can’t shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a

note from the beyond!",19
Ross," You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to… (Opens the

door to find Jill standing there.) Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that’s just a little game

I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they’ve really taken a liking to me.

(Quickly looks out to see if they’re watching.) Uhh

what’s-what’s-what’s the matter?",58
Ross," Well, I’d love to! Here, you wait right here and I’ll go get the

projector and my notes!",18
Rachel, Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can’t find her anywhere.,11
Rachel," Well, is Ross home? Maybe I’ll just call him to see if he’s

actually seen her. ",16
Phoebe, (seeing her dress) Oh God. So-so you’re making porn movies.,10
Phoebe," No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! (Yells into

the apartment) And shame on all of you! You’re disgusting! Especially you (points to

someone) with that! (Storms away.)",34
Rachel," (on phone) What is my sister doing there?! And why are the

drapes shut?!",14
Ross," O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she’s really upset we’re

just talking.",11
Rachel," Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get

back at me!",17
Ross," So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t

have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put

on a great slide show!",35
Rachel," Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!",15
Ross," Y’know what? I think I can take care of myself, I’ll talk to you

later. Good-bye. (Hangs up the phone and turns to find Jill sitting really close to him.)

Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you’re just using me.",44
Phoebe," So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.",10
Phoebe," No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay’s checks; there were a

lot of them.",17
Phoebe," Um-mmm, and I won’t have to go there anymore because I gave

them my correct address.",16
Joey," That’s great, but isn’t it gonna bother that people still think

you’re a porn star?",15
Phoebe," Yeah. (She notices some guy putting a coat on his girlfriend is trying

to remember where he’s seen her before.) (To him) You’re trying to figure out

where you know me from? All right, I’ll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? (He tries

to rush his girlfriend out.) Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! (To

Joey) See?",62
Ross," (To Rachel) You uh, you may have been right about Jill.",11
Ross," Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?",10
Rachel," Well, it doesn’t sound like it! I mean, it’s pretty easy not

to kiss someone, you just don’t kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!",28
Ross," Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it.

I guess I-I just wasn’t thinking…",19
Rachel," Yeah that’s right you weren’t thinking! Y’know what? Let

me give you something to think about! (She pulls up her sleeves and steps towards him.)",25
Ross," Oh wait—hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the

kissing.",13
Rachel," Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth

long enough to tell me that.",19
Ross," Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing

could ever happen with us!",19
Ross," No, I mean, look I don’t know if anything is going to happen with us,

again. Ever. But I don’t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she

got mad and broke my projector.",39
Rachel," Wow. I, I don’t even know what to say. Thank you. (Gently kicks

him.)",14
Chandler," (crying hysterically) I just don’t see why those two can’t

work things out!",13
Rachel," (not buying it) Jill, you can uh, you 

can stop that now. I know you made up with Daddy. ",19
Rachel,"  Oh, just a wild guess, and uh, 

your limo just pulled up.  (There is a limo in front of Central Perk.)",21
Chandler," (starts crying) I-I can’t believe Jill’s gone. (They all

look at him.) I can’t help it, I opened a gate.",20
Joey," (he’s just picked up their bill) Hey! So, what’s with the 20

percent tip? Did I do something wrong?",19
Joey," Y’know what’s more generous than that?! Fifty percent!

Y’know what’s even more generous than that?!!",15
Joey," All right, look I’m sorry you guys, but it’s just that I gotta

get these new head shots made. And they’re really expensive, y’know? I’m

down to like three! Well, actually two ‘cause one of ‘em I kinda blackened in

some teeth—Why did I do that?! (Hits himself in the head.)",51
Ross," Well isn’t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I

mean, can’t-can’t you pick up, I don’t know, an extra shift here?",26
Phoebe," Or, y’know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if

you’ve got y’know a little of this (she sticks her chest out and shakes it)

goin’ on. Wow! I still have it!",35
Ross," Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe

you’ll get that job!",15
Joey," Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down

on me all the time!",18
Joey," No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember?

Let’s see uh, well I don’t want to donate sperm again. (To Ross) I really prefer

doing that at the home office y’know? (Ross nods his head.) Ooh-ooh, maybe they want

like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?",54
Joey," Well, where was I? (Takes a sip of the coffee.)",10
Rachel," Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!",15
Rachel," What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there (points) and

pretend you’re a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!",22
Ross," Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming,

that’s not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there’s a

concept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call (he holds two

fingers up to his temple, and he does this every time he says this word) unagi.",59
Rachel, Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!,11
Phoebe, (deadpan) Come on Ross. We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is.,12
Ross," Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi

can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!",24
Phoebe," You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or

your kettle of fish?",18
Ross," (moves closer) All I’m saying is, it’s one thing being prepared

for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I

don’t know, like a (turns and puts his face close to Rachel’s and screams) surprise!!",42
Ross," All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn’t mean you

have unagi. (Does the finger thing.)",19
Rachel," (To Phoebe) Ooh! Y’know what? If we made reservations, we could

have unagi in about a half-hour.",17
Chandler," Okay, look I need your help, I don’t know what to get her for

Valentine’s Day.",16
Rachel," Well, Valentine’s Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn’t

get her a calendar!",15
Chandler," (laughs) She was working on Valentine’s Day so we’re

celebrating it tonight.",12
Joey," Ohh, hey! Why don’t you book a date for both of you at one of those

romantic spas?",18
Chandler," Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend (pause) and her

brother, (the camera pans to Ross flashing Joey a very evil look; Joey gets scared) I

can’t do that we promised we’d make each other gifts this year.",40
Joey," You can’t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of

scissors and you just cut…",17
Rachel," (interrupting him) Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like

so much fun.",12
Chandler," Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.",14
Chandler," Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?",13
Phoebe," Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! (She

takes out a sock that’s been made into a bunny with eyes, nose, mouth, whiskers, and

two other socks sown onto it for ears.) Oh for crying out loud!",42
Phoebe," Now, it’s you little bunny friend. (She sticks it in Rachel’s

face and they both laugh.)",16
Chandler," (admiring his work) This, this actually is a… (Does the same

gibberish word from before.)",15
Chandler," Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine’s Day

gifts?",13
Chandler," Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place

where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.",23
Monica," Okay. (They kiss.) Okay, I can’t wait! This is going to be the best

Valentine’s Day ever! (Chandler giggles and exits.) I can’t believe it! Make the

presents! Make the presents!",31
Monica," I’m just so excited to make the presents! (Chandler does another

sarcastic/scared laugh and leaves.) Shoot!",16
Joey," (to the receptionist) Hi uh, I’m Joey Tribbiani and with all do

respect I’d like to donate some fluids.",19
Joey," Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up. (She just looks at

him in horror.) Uh, are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in?",27
Joey," Thanks. (Starts to read it.) Well but this one starts now. (Points to

one.)",14
Joey," Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on

attractive nurse receptionists.",15
Ross," A lesson in the importance of unagi. (He starts doing the finger thing

every time now.)",16
Ross," Perhaps. Now I’m curious, at what point during those girlish screams

would you have begun to kick my ass?",19
Ross," I’m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but

I—look, I just want you guys to be safe. (Monica comes out to throw out the garbage

and Ross screams…) DANGER!!!!! (She completely ignores him and keeps walking.)

Ahhh, huh? Unagi.",45
Joey," (in his head) 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin.

Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me? (The camera widens its shot to

reveal a room full of Joey look-a-likes. Joey looks at the guy next to him and then back

at his script.)",54
Chandler," Okay, are you aware unagi (does the finger thing) is an eel?",12
Ross," Oh, why don’t you make her one of your little jokes.",11
Chandler," I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that

looks homemade?",14
Ross," Y’know what? She’d-she’d love this. (Picks up a model of

the Saturn V rocket, that’s the one that took man to the moon.) Uh, it’s an

exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.",38
Chandler," Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to

the moon.",18
Ross," Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. But

you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return

safely. (Apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read the

Christmas Story from the orbit of the moon on Christmas Eve, 1968. They also took the

famous Earthrise picture of the Earth rising over the moon.)",69
Chandler," Because it says ""Captain Ross"" on the side and ""I hate

Monica"" on the bottom.",15
Chandler," Okay. Okay. (He goes to the closet, moves the clothes out of the way,

and notices an empty hanger. He takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. Then

he holds it out as if he’s giving it to her.) Yes honey, I made it myself. (He throws

it down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out a

pair of scissors. He turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties he

just removed.) I can’t do it. I can’t do it. (He throws them both down and

continues looking. He opens another closet door and finds a tape.) Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A

mixed tape!! (He runs out into the living room.)",128
Monica," Okay! (She takes her present for him and they move over to sit on the

couch.)",16
Chandler," Now, it’s not wrapped because I just, just finished it.",10
Chandler, But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.,14
Monica," Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!",13
Monica," Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See

that’s what this is about.",19
Monica," No! No, she doesn’t. Uh Phoebe, what she makes—that’s

uh—they’re sock rabbits. They are completely different—Okay! Okay! Okay! I

didn’t make it! I’m sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that

we’re supposed to make the presents!",39
Monica," No-no, it’s not okay! It’s not! I mean you were just…

You’re so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for

me! Y’know I’m just gonna—I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am

going to cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and I am going to do

anything you want in there! (Points to the bedroom.)",71
Chandler," (thinking it over) Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape. (They

both run into the bedroom.)",20
Chandler," Wow! (To the sock bunny still on his hand.) You are way to

young to have seen that!",18
Monica," Oops! (Covers its eyes.) Y’know, your birthday is in a

month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?",25
Monica, We have got to wash that! (Referring to the sock bunny.),11
Chandler, Yeah! (Takes it off his hand and throws it behind the night-stand.),12
Monica," Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was

too expensive?",16
Monica, I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!,11
Chandler," Well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.",12
Joey," (entering) No! No! No! No! No! How you doin’?! How you

doin’—Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall! (Goes into the hall.)",22
Joey," Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.",10
Joey," Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a

medical research project.",21
Chandler," Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you,

aren’t they?",14
Joey," Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y’know? The

only problem is, Carl’s acting is… (Does the international hand symbol for

so-so.)",27
Joey," Yeah, he’s the reason I didn’t get that big Minute Maid

commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed

it up.",29
Joey, (to Carl) Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! (Carl does so.),11
Rachel," Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host,

who’s ass I cannot kick.",16
Ross," Y’know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you

can get very, very hurt!",20
Joey," All right Carl, we’re next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?",12
Joey," (gets very angry) Damnit Carl! (Carl goes to say something more, and Joey

silences him with a grunt.)",18
Monica," Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3,

macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.",19
Chandler," Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.",12
Monica," I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to

that tape you made me.",19
Monica, The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?,11
Chandler," No! You’re the sweetest! (He tries to kiss her but Monica backs

away with a look that could kill on her face.)",22
Ross," Yeah, yeah, I was watching. (The instructor just nods and walks away.)

Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the

woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?",41
Ross," No, I mean it’s okay, I mean, they’re-they’re my friends.

In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.",19
Ross," Oh, no! No-no! No, I tried! But I couldn’t. That’s why I’m

here. Maybe we could attack them together? (He glares at him.) That-that’s a no.",26
Chandler," And I will cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and

do anything in there! (Points to the bedroom.)",22
Monica," (pointing to the kitchen) Yeah you will! (Points to the bedroom) And,

are you kiddin’ me?!",16
Chandler," Come on Monica, it’s our Valentine’s Day. Please?

Please-please, please?",10
Monica, I am!! (Enter her room and closes the door behind her.),11
Ross," Ah-ha, nowhere to run! (He starts to run towards them.)",10
Rachel," I don’t like sitting up here! I’m just gonna over… (She

starts to get up.)",15
Rachel, Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!,10
Ross," Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one

student wrote, ""I loved Dr. Geller’s class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller,

you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!""",34
Chandler," Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there’s a big

selling calendar, eh?",12
Ross," Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.",11
Joey," Oh, ‘cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the

same handwriting and boom, there’s your admirer. (Ross is stunned.)",23
Chandler, A hot girl’s at stake and all of the sudden he’s Rain Man.,13
Rachel," Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a

girl?",17
Ross," It’s a girl! Anyway, it wou—it wouldn’t matter. Okay?

Because I’m a teacher and she’s a student.",17
Joey," Oh, well think of it like this, when you’re 90…",10
Ross," I know when I’m 90 she’ll be like 80 and it won’t seem like

such a big difference.",18
Joey," No that’s not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to

say is when you’re 90 you’ll still have the memory of what it was like to be

with a 20-year-old.",37
Joey," (entering) Hey Chandler! Y’know that girl you went to college with who-who

became a movie director?",16
Chandler," Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.",10
Joey," Oh well listen, anyway she’s directing the new Al Pacino movie. You

gotta get me an audition!",17
Chandler," Oh, I don’t know man. I haven’t talked to her in like ten

years.",14
Chandler," You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four

hundred…",13
Joey," Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the

call or what?",16
Joey," All right! Thanks! You’re the best! Now listen, the last day of

auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember

Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?",33
Joey," (angrily) Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this,

the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What

day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!",33
Joey," Okay. (picks up the same table centerpiece 

Chandler did earlier) Hey, Monica...?",12
Rachel, (entering from the bathroom) Hey Mon? I’m gonna check my messages.,11
Monica," Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.",11
Rachel," (on phone) Hello? (Shocked that someone answered.) Uh, Rachel. (To the

gang.) Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!",21
Rachel," (on phone) Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! (Hangs up) That was the fire

department, there was a fire at our place!",24
Rachel," Well, he didn’t say, but it was a fire. I’m guessing not very

good. Come on, we gotta go!",19
Monica, Come on! (The girls all run out and Joey holds up Chandler by smiling.),14
Joey," The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!",16
Ross," Oh thank you. Thanks very much. (Leans up against the board and on a

thumbtack.) Ow! (He pulls away.)",19
Ross," Oh I, I don’t-I don’t think that would be the best idea.",12
Phoebe," Coming through! (Has to dodge a fireman) Oh! Coming through! (Sees a

cute one.) Oh! Hello! Hi! (Smiles then realizes) No! Right! Coming through! ",24
Joey," (to the fireman) Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this

Thursday?",15
Monica," Joey! He’s working! (To Chandler) You would look good in

that.",11
Phoebe," Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that

isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!",23
Rachel," Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue

sweater. (Hold it up.)",15
Rachel, Fine! I’m sorry for your loss! (Hands it back to her.),11
Rachel," (stands up) Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be

hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.",32
Monica," (pulling Rachel back down) Yes, they can stay with us.",10
Chandler, Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?,10
Phoebe," No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.",11
Phoebe," Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It’s me!

It’s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!",29
Rachel," Okay Phoebe calm down, there’s no need to place blame. Okay? (To

the fireman) I warned her about those candles.",20
Chandler," God, it’s great to catch up! I can’t believe how long

it’s been!",13
Joey," Chandler, is that… (Mimes someone using a movie camera and Chandler

nods yes.)",13
Chandler," Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm… (Joey mimes

throwing something in the air, catching it, rolling it out, putting it in an oven and

cutting it.) Can you hold for one second please? (To Joey) What?!",39
Joey," When you’re off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?",11
Chandler," (on phone) Hi! I’m back. (Goes to hang up the phone.) Yeah, that

sounds great. (Listens) Okay. Well, we’ll do it then. (Listens) Okay, bye-bye. (He

hangs up the phone and turns around to see Joey standing close to him and screams.)",42
Joey," Hey listen, so when’s-when’s my audition? I mean I know

it’s Thursday, but what time?",15
Chandler," (To Joey) We didn’t get to the audition. I’m gonna take her

to coffee and then we’ll do it then.",20
Monica," Wow! So, now you’re going on a date with this girl?",11
Chandler," Honey, it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years!

You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask them

for a favor. There are rules, y’know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.",46
Monica," You’re right, I’m sorry. It’s not like you’re

y’know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.",14
Monica," All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey

a favor?!",16
Joey," Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. (He turns

around to see Chandler glaring at him.)",22
Chandler," (laughs) Oh that’s great, my friend Joey’s in the movie

business.",11
Monica," Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?",14
Rachel, Oh my God! It sure didn’t look this way when I lived here.,13
Monica," I know! Now look, there’s only one problem though. There’s

only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.",26
Phoebe," Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess (To Rachel) you should

get to stay here.",18
Rachel," Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an

accident.",14
Phoebe," Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.",13
Monica," So Rach! You’re the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you’ll

just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring

them to you, y’know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.",43
Joey," This right here is where I keep the pizza. (He points to the chair.) And

uh that’s where the napkin is. (Points to the floor next to the chair.)",29
Ross," What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.",13
Ross," Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone’s name, so I-I kinda came

up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.",28
Ross," Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I’m having a great time! Y’know how

before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I

thought it would be too, but it’s not. I mean it’s not at all.",43
Rachel," I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.",14
Rachel," Well, don’t look at me! My hair’s straight! Straight!

Straight! Straight!",11
Joey," This is where I keep the pizza. (It’s the same location as before.)

And—Hey! Where did the napkin go?! (The napkin is not in it’s spot.) ",26
Rachel," (smells something) What is that? (sniffs 

again) Is that old shrimp?",11
Monica, Now there you go! I wouldn’t want my best guest to strain her eyes!,14
Phoebe," What the smell from Joey’s? No, I can hardly smell it over here.",13
Monica," Well you let me know if you can, because y’know I can bake a pie to

cover it.",18
Monica," Hello? (Listens) Oh yes, one minute please. (To Phoebe) It’s for

you. It’s the fire inspector.",16
Phoebe," Oh! (Takes the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Yeah this is Phoebe. (Listens)

Really?!",12
Joey," (in a funny voice) Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn’t the hair

straightener that started the fire. (Rachel prompts him on what to say next.) No-no, it

was the candles. It’s very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the

first things they teach you in fire school is… (Phoebe suddenly enters.) Uhh…

Uhh… Okay. Well, I have to go now. (Phoebe leaves.)",67
Ross," We had such a great time! She’s-she’s incredible! I thought

the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t at all.

Elizabeth is very mature for her age. (Joey makes the international sign for big boobies.)

(To Monica) A concept lost on some people!",47
Ross," Well, not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the

rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last

night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.",30
Monica," Well Ross, you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputation

as y’know Professor McNails-His-Students. ",17
Joey," Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what’s more important? What

people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.",25
Joey," Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a

block of time open say Thursday?",20
Chandler," Hey, relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight.",12
Ross," Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh… (Does the international sign for big

boobies.)",12
Chandler," Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should

stay!",10
Chandler," (breaking up) Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh…",10
Chandler," Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I

have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this

umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on

Thursday?",55
Chandler," Well, the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later. (He runs

off and leaves her with the bill, which the waiter promptly delivers.)",25
Phoebe," Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.",10
Phoebe," Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potato

chips.",12
Monica, But you should eat them now because they’re hot from the oven.,12
Monica," (pulling the plate back) Oh-ho! But not in here! Can’t eat ‘em

in bed, remember? No crumbies!",17
Phoebe," (gritting her teeth) Okay, I’ll be out in a second.",10
Joey, Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.),11
Joey," All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up and

eats it.)",17
Ross, What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?,14
Ross," Y’know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to…

(He sees some of his colleagues enter and puts his head on her lap.)",27
Ross," What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?",11
Ross," What?! No! No! Wait! You’re right, this is stupid. Who cares what

people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There’s nothing wrong with

that. Come on. (They get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.)

Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.",50
Ross," That’s right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we’re

dating. And you may frown upon that, but we’re not gonna hide it anymore.",25
Joey," Oh, very funny. I don’t know if you remember, but my audition was

supposed to be Thursday. (Chandler doesn’t say anything until Joey figures it out.)

You got me the audition?! Let’s hug it up! (They hug.)",37
Chandler," Okay. Okay. (Joey puts him down.) What are you gonna do to me if you

get the part?",18
Phoebe," (To Rachel) Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!",12
Phoebe," Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started

the fire but I think I’m partly at fault. You see, I didn’t, I didn’t tell

you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y’know let’s just

face it, that’s just kindling! So I think it’s better that I stay at

Joey’s.",59
Rachel," No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what?

I’m fine here.",14
Phoebe," (To Rachel) Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me

crazy!",14
Joey," That’s right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey’s.",10
Rachel," No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don’t want to switch! Please come on! I

can throw wet paper towels here!",20
Phoebe, No but at Monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink!,11
Phoebe," All right fine! This looks like so much fun. (Examining the bowl of wet

paper towels.)",16
Phoebe," God, what a mess. (She grabs the bowl and heads for Monica’s.)",12
Ross," Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can’t date you or have a hot

plate in my office. I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other.",29
Ross," I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’s

against the rules. It’s forbidden.",19
Ross," Well I-I-I don’t care how hot it is it’s-it’s uh, it’s

wrong.",12
Ross," (feeling it too) No! No! It’s wrong! It’s-it’s-it’s

naughty. It’s taboo.",11
Joey," Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what?

Thurs—(He gasps in horror.) Oh! (Runs out and Chandler just shakes his head. After a

second Joey runs back in to grab a piece of pizza and runs back out.)",41
Joey," Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! (He grabs a

screwdriver and starts to attack the compressor, only he causes a small short circuit and

shocks himself.) Ah-ah!! Damn fridge! ",34
Joey," Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to

get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.",31
Rachel," I’m not paying for half of that! I’m only staying here until

my apartment gets fixed.",16
Joey," Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now,

I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that

tell ya’?",34
Joey," All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a

time, I’ll take a check for the other hundred.",26
Chandler," Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. (Pats Joey’s

arm, Joey pats Chandler’s shoulder, and Chandler motions for Joey to say the same

about him.)",29
Rachel," Anyway, there’s this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren

bought a table, so I kinda have to go…",20
Rachel," I don’t know, something either trees or disease—Ralph mumbles

a lot.",11
Rachel, Yeah! It’s weird. But the thing is need to find a date.,12
Rachel," Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a

tux.",15
Chandler, So he has to be a male who has at least $50.,12
Phoebe," Y’know, this is probably none of my business, but weren’t you

guys supposed to not be seen in public together?",20
Ross," Oh no-no-no, we’re just two people who happen to run into each other

here at the coffee house. (He winks at her.)",22
Chandler," So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of

homework to do?",19
Rachel," Well, y’know it’s just been so long since I’ve been to Chuckie

Cheese.",13
Monica," Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early

this year! Y’know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.",27
Joey," Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how’s it

going with her?",16
Ross," Well, actually it’s been great. She’s 20 so she’s not

looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.",22
Monica," Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.",10
Ross," Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really

means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are…",32
Phoebe," (interrupting) Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?",14
Monica," Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?",10
Phoebe," Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.",15
Phoebe," Oh that’s good, I guess she’ll have a choice between my guy

and your weirdo.",15
Monica, (laughs sarcastically) Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.,11
Phoebe," My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these (She

squeezes the skin on her chin together to form…)",25
Monica," Well, uh y’know, our guy works with Chandler and he’s really

nice and smart and he’s a great dresser!",19
Phoebe," Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He’s a massage client and one

time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.",30
Monica," All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really

funny.",16
Monica, (To Chandler) Do you want our guy to be your guy?,11
Joey," The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream,

limes—Hey, what was in that brown jar?",19
Joey," Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?",11
Joey," And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I

gotta buy a new kid.",20
Chandler," (not quite sure where Joey’s going and is a little worried)

Okay…",12
Ross," Hmm? (Turns around and sees that its Elizabeth) Oh, a student I don’t

know.",14
Ross," Shh! (Laughs then composes himself) Of course, why don’t we go

inside?",12
Ross," (quickly jumping away from Elizabeth) Yes, professor

Feesen-sen-stenlger… I’ll be with you in one moment. (To Elizabeth) So, I will

take one box of the Thin Mints. (And he ushers Elizabeth out of the office.)",35
Ross," You don’t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip

with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I’m not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I

tell her?",33
Chandler, Just tell her the truth! Tell her you’re not ready.,10
Ross," I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?",10
Joey," Or! You can just, y’know… (He walks up close to whisper in

Ross’s ear and when he gets there he pushes Ross into the fridge.)",25
Joey, What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!,12
Ross," What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!",12
Joey," Oh-ho-ho, you think I don’t know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me!

(He opens the door and feels inside.) Well what do you know! Broken! That’ll be $400!",28
Ross," Joey, I did not break this! Okay? (He opens the freezer and smells inside

and recoils in disgust.) That has been broken for a while.",25
Joey," All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?",13
Joey, I still haven’t gotten a check for your half yet.,10
Ross," Yeah, it kinda grows on you. (They both laugh.) Actually, I wanted to

finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.",21
Ross," Look, I… (He has trouble sitting in his chair.) Look, I’m having

a great time with you and I just don’t want us to move to fast or put to much

pressure on us. So, I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet.

It’s-it’s too soon.",50
Ross," No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant

was…",13
Ross," Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She

didn’t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she’s going

to Florida for spring vacation.",34
Chandler," Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for

spring break? (Does a little whooping/party noise.)",21
Monica," Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents.

Spring break you’re doing frat guys.",16
Ross," Hey, y’know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.",10
Chandler," I can see it now, ""Look dad, it’s the Sphinx!"" (Does

that party noise again.)",15
Ross," Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, ""Spring

break!"" (Imitates the party noise.) All right? I mean she’s taken my class!",24
Rachel," Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.",10
Rachel," We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field

& Stream. (Chandler’s shocked.) What? I read that.",24
Rachel, Oh yes! Thank you! (He does so and Rachel sits down on the couch.),14
Phoebe," You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your

own!",17
Monica, Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler’s work!,13
Phoebe, Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.,12
Rachel," Well, y’know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I

think I’m just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.",21
Phoebe," No reason, it’s just I know a single guy that cares about other

people.",14
Rachel," Oh, but y’know, no, you didn’t give me your phone number.",11
Rachel," I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of

you!",15
Phoebe," Yeah, y’know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the

kind of guy you’d like to take to a ball? ""Hey Sebastian, would you like to

dance?"" (Imitates him.) ""Uhh, okay—I gotta go!""",35
Monica," All right guys stop it. Rachel, we’re very sorry that is a very

insensitive thing for us to do. And y’know what? Let us make it up to you, we have

two really great guys for you.",37
Phoebe," Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y’know you might even end up with

someone really special (whispers) if you pick my guy.",23
Chandler," Okay now it doesn’t matter which one you choose, y’know?

It’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe

deemed not good enough to go out with herself.",37
Joey," (entering) Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me

400 bucks!",15
Phoebe," Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your

last ten auditions.",16
Chandler," (To Ross) Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?",11
Ross," Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo.

That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl’s bodies,

waking up next to people you don’t even know…",37
Joey," Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel

Corona?",16
Joey," So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y’know who

knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.",20
Phoebe," Ross, you can’t tell her not to go. You just started dating.",12
Ross," Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?",13
Rachel," I'm sorry, this is very serious. It is. 

And you know what, Ross? Here, you like her, she likes you, everything's going 

to be fine. ",25
Ross," You're right. I'm just probably 

overreacting. So if she is staying at this party hotel on the beach with a huge 

pool and free drinks with every meal. ",28
Joey," Well, if she's got enough money for that, 

she can certainly pay for the fridge she broke. ",17
Ross," Sure. Sure. Look I don’t, I don’t know if your plans are

finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.",26
Ross," Well, yeah, of-of course I’m okay! What? I’m just being

supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and (notices something) what-what

is uh, what’s this? (He holds up a rather skimpy bathing suit.)",34
Monica," You’re gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet

him?",15
Rachel, I don’t know. I know I don’t work late tomorrow night.,11
Chandler," Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y’know

what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? (Laughs) Eldad come

here! (He stands up from the next table.)",35
Chandler," Eldad, sit down. (To Rachel) Move over! Move over now!",10
Rachel, I—Ohh! (Moves over and lets Eldad sit on the couch.),10
Chandler, There you go! There you are! (Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler),12
Monica," Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! (They start to leave but run into Phoebe

with her guy in tow.) (To Phoebe) What are you doing here?!",27
Chandler," Hi. (To Phoebe) Okay, you’re too late okay? Because she’s

already with our guy.",14
Phoebe," (looks) Oh my God, you’re right! I am too late; they’re

sitting on the couch and talking! (To Patrick) Come on! (They go over to the couch.)

Rachel?",28
Phoebe," Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about. ",10
Phoebe," Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what’s

underneath it.",14
Phoebe," Oh! Okay! Yeah, that’s okay. (To Patrick) Have a seat. (Sits

Patrick down next to Rachel.)",16
Chandler, It is the softest hair! Touch it! (Both he and Monica do so.),13
Phoebe, Rachel? Patrick is really rich. (To Patrick) Give her some money.,11
Chandler," (To Rachel) Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! (To

Eldad) You dance for Rachel!",17
Rachel," No-no! Don’t dance for me! Please? Don’t! (She gets up to yell

at her ‘friends.’) What is the matter with you guys?",22
Rachel, I… Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?,11
Rachel," I’ll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It’s you guys! Come

on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!",30
Rachel," I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually

liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean (To Patrick) congratulations on all

the cash, (He nods) and-and y’know—(Feels Eldad’s hair)—Wow! You do

have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through

anymore of this! Good-bye! (Grabs her stuff, starts to leave, then turns back suddenly,

and to Eldad) Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!",89
Ross," Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?",10
Ross," It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm,

I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it’s revealing which I’m

fine with, no I’m concerned about your health, sun exposure.",39
Ross," Well, if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you

get 30, sometimes it’s-it’s get 4, and I swear to God more often than not

it’s just milk.",31
Rachel," Oh that’s all right! Y’know, I ended up having a really good

time. Y’know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and

awareness.",29
Joey, I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.,14
Joey," We've got 3 minutes till the reactor blows. We’re never gonna

make it!",13
Phoebe," Don’t worry about me, I’m a robot! I’m just a machine!!",11
Phoebe," (interrupting) No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.",11
Joey," Y’know what? I think that’s enough for now. Yeah. I don’t

want to be over rehearsed.",16
Phoebe," (tremendously overacting) Fine! I’ll do it without you! (Joey gives

her thumbs up) I don’t need you or anybody else! I’m gonna make it on my own!

(Joey closes the door to his bedroom.) You’ll see!! You’ll all see!! ",39
Chandler," (To Joey) So uh, what’s this thing you’re auditioning for?",10
Joey," Oh, it’s a new TV show. Yeah. I’m up for the part of Mac

Macaveli or ""Mac."" Yeah, I’m a detective and I solve crimes with the help

of my robot partner. He’s a, he’s a Computerized Humanoid Electronically

Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or ""C.H.E.E.S.E.""",44
Joey," That’s the title! Yeah! Y’know they really lucked out that the

initials spell cheese.",14
Rachel," Huh—Wait so Joey if you get this, you’re gonna be like the

star of your own TV show! I mean you’ll be like the Big Cheese! (To Phoebe) Or the

Big Mac—Hey! You love those!",35
Joey," Well, don’t get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.",11
Joey," I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don’t know if

I’m good enough.",18
Rachel," Joey, what are you talking about? You’re a terrific actor.",10
Joey,"  Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to

work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.",20
Joey,"  It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes

you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this

big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. (Does this intense look where

it looks like he's smelling a fart.)",54
Joey," (there's a gunshot on TV) There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on

tv] ""Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.  I'm

afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from

a..."" (Does the smell-the-fart look.)",43
Joey," (on stage in an Austrian accent) Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork

here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and

dance number.) ",33
Ross,  So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?,10
Phoebe," (overacting with a song this time) (singing) Gooood luck! Gooood

luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!",17
Phoebe," Wow, if I could dance, I'd be a triple 

threat. ",10
Joey," Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn’t even be

an actor!",12
Ross," Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn’t

go well but it really did go well?",21
Joey," And I know both of them, they’re really good. One of them is the guy

from those allergy commercials who’s always getting chased by those big flowers…",27
Joey," I’m just so nervous! Y’know? The callback isn’t until

tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!",21
Joey," There’s just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys

do is very different. I don’t know if you’d understand.",23
Ross," Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.",12
Chandler," (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the

WENUS and I'm not happy!",20
Monica,"  Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.",10
Rachel,"  (on the phone) Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year

old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it! (Pause) I’m telling you

I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I

am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you

get this message. (Hangs up.)",70
Phoebe,"  Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...

(The flashback shows Paulo lying face down on the massage table and slowly moving his

hands up Phoebe's legs and grabbing her butt.)",35
Phoebe,"  And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (The

flashback shows Paulo rolling over and showing Phoebe his equipment.)",22
Ross, You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!,10
Ross, MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.),10
Joey," I want this part so much! Y’know? If I don’t get this part

I’m never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!—No, I didn’t say

that! That’s a lie.",28
Chandler," Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean,

is it okay if they come visit?",22
Chandler," Oh right, your allergies. (Monica leaves and to the chick and duck)

All her, she hates you. (Chandler leaves without finishing the message for Joey.)",25
Joey," Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like

a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?",29
Chandler," Well, maybe we can fix it y’know? Maybe we can send him some-some

big-big flowers and scare him!",18
Joey," How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could’ve turned my

whole career around!",16
Chandler," I messed up. Okay? I’m sorry, I really messed up.",10
Joey," Hey, you don’t even live here anymore! What are you doing answering

my phone? I have my machine!",18
Chandler," Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a

copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody’s

allowed one mistake, right?",36
Chandler,"  You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of

golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller!  The eyesore from the

Liberace house of crap!",35
Chandler,"  Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around

sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]",26
Chandler,"  I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the

fool that. . . [turns around and sees Joey] Hi!",26
Chandler,"  Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to

talking, and one thing to another and…",21
Chandler,"  You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the

line.",12
Joey,"  Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line,

that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!",23
Chandler," Look, I’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But

you’re not perfect! You’ve made some errors in judgment too!",21
Joey," (getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!",11
Chandler,"  What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where

the hell is all of our stuff?!!",18
Joey,"  Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he

didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!",23
Joey,"  I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that

guy again, do you know what I’m gonna do?",24
Chandler," Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.",14
Joey, No way!  I've been going to the guy for 12 years.,11
Chandler," Oh come on!  He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his

hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...",25
Joey," That's how they do pants!  Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how

they measure pants?",16
Monica," Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen!

There aren’t any message you’ve forgotten to give me are there? (Chandler has a

disgusted look on his face.) Apparently you’re not very good at it! I…",38
Rachel," Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive

yourself!",14
Monica," Y’know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad

with me when I go answer the phone just in case… (Chandler gets that disgusted look

back.) Okay…",31
Rachel," I’m sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there!

Y’know, you fight, you make up, it’s just the way it works.",24
Rachel," Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took

full responsibility for!!",16
Ross," I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I

didn’t finish the whole letter!",17
Rachel," Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back

together again! We are so over!!",16
Ross," (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind

it)",15
Rachel," And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t

happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!",22
Rachel, Would you let me talk. [flicks Monica on the forehead],10
Rachel," OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her

back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]",20
Phoebe," Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.",10
Phoebe," There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be,

like, my bitches.",17
Joey," Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything

you own.",14
Joey," Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes?

Maybe if I wasn't going commando...",18
Joey," Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any,

I don't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)",24
Chandler," The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it, they needed to see you at 2

o’clock.",15
Chandler," Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board,

then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross’s! I went to the

coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!",44
Joey," Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to

the audition! I got the part!!",18
Chandler," (angrily) Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over

here!",13
Joey," Oh wow! Okay man, I’m sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.",15
Chandler," Well that’s good. Because you didn’t! And I’m

incredibly happy for ya!!",12
Joey," Yeah, you’re right. Okay look, listen, let’s talk about what a

huge star I’m gonna be!",16
Chandler, You are gonna be a huge star! I’m gonna hug ya!,11
Joey," Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I’m not leaving without you! Try routing your

backup source through your primary CPU.",17
Phoebe," (overacting badly) I can’t! My circuits are fried! They’re

fried I tell you!!",13
Joey," Wow! (Back to reading the scene.) Well then I’ll just have to carry

you.",14
Ross," That’ll be a neat trick, when you’re, (looks at the script) when

you’re dead!",14
Ross," There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired. ",11
Phoebe," I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like,

""Ooh, where’d Ross go?""",18
Ross, Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac…,14
Joey," Y’know what? I think that’s enough for today. Thanks for your

help! (He grabs their scripts and heads for his room.)",21
Rachel," And your horoscope says, ""On the fifth a special someone is going

to give you a gift.""",17
Chandler," (To Monica) Oh, well thank you in advance. (Kisses her.)",10
Monica," (To Chandler) You are going to make a joke about my special

present! Why would you do that?!",18
Rachel," Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.",11
Rachel," (ecstatic) Oh my God! It’s Joey Tribbiani of Mac and

C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!",11
Chandler," Oh that’s right. It’s your first day! So are you psyched to

fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?",19
Joey," Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I’ve dreamed about this

for years! Why have I not been preparing?!",22
Joey," But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don’t know anything

about technology! I can’t even use Chandler’s computer except to find porn!

And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on!",38
Monica, I think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month.,12
Chandler," Are you judging them by their covers? Because you’re really not

supposed to do that.",15
Phoebe," No, I’m just deciding which one to use—I’m gonna start

writing another book!",13
Phoebe," Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one

who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received. 

But, y'know, I lost all of them in the fire. So this one-this one I'm gonna keep 

in an asbestos-lined box far way from Rachel. (Rachel glares at her.) Who I 

forgive. (Rachel still glares at her.)   ",70
Phoebe," Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.",11
Ross, (continuing) I just found out that Elizabeth’s dad wants to meet me.,12
Chandler," Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not Elizabeth’s dad?!",10
Ross," That's the only one you get. (To the rest) 

And he hates me! Okay, he apparently asked Elizabeth why she'd want to go out 

with a guy who couldn't get a girl his own age!",35
Rachel," Huh, and-and what did she say to that? 

(She giggles.)",10
Ross," And that's yours.  (To 

the rest) Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help

me out if you guys were here to make me look good.",33
Joey," Wow! Huh? (Picks up the phone) Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!

(Goes over to a bookshelf) Ooh, huh, look at all these 

books I've read. ",24
Joey," Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?",11
Joey," Oh wow! He’s so lifelike! (Starts touching the guy’s cheeks)

Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy’s ears.",18
Joey," (slaps Wayne on his cheek) How do you do there, Wayne? (Backs away.)",13
Joey," Okay. Sorry about that…(Mimics that cheek thing he just did.) Uh, so

where’s C.H.E.E.S.E.?",14
Joey," Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot,

y’know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.",26
Joey," I’m sorry, it just—I don’t know it doesn’t really look

like it can do anything.",15
Ross," Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one

chance I can, I can change your mind.",25
Ross," Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this

before. I mean, I mean I’ve been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never

done it with a student—I mean I not—not it! I mean, I mean I

don’t—We haven’t done it. Uh, I mean, I mean,

we’ve-we’ve-we’ve done stuff. (Paul is not amused.) Okay, okay, a joke, a

joke—lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.",82
Ross," Oh God, thank you! (Runs and gives all of them a group hug.) Umm, uh, Mr.

Stevens I’d like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.",31
Phoebe," You’re Elizabeth’s father, huh? I can see now where she gets

her rugged handsomeness.",14
Ross," Okay umm, why don’t we all take a seat, y’know? And uh, and

I’ll get us all some uh some coffees—(He goes to pull out Elizabeth’s

chair, but Paul steps in)—Yeah, why don’t you. (Paul pulls out her chair) Uh and

you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y’know? Whatever pops into your

head. (He turns his back to Paul and Elizabeth and points to himself for Chandler, Monica,

and Phoebe. Then he goes to order the coffee.)",80
Monica," Y’know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day,

‘cause usually he’s got the children’s hospital.",19
Chandler," But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college.

Uh, funny story… (He starts laughing then notices that Paul isn’t happy.)

You’re roommate in college died didn’t he?",34
Ross," (returning with the coffee) Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. (He sets

down their cups.) So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.",26
Rachel," Hi, I’m sorry I’m late but I am ready, ready to talk you up!

When does Liz’s father get here?",20
Chandler," (entering from the bathroom) Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were

gonna to get the kind with the baby.",26
Phoebe," (writing frantically) You guys, I’m sorry, could you please talk a

little slower? ",13
Phoebe," Yeah, it’s about relationships. Y’know? The traps, the

pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!",19
Phoebe," And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.

(Chandler and Monica kiss.) And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as

it’s a compliment.",32
Rachel," Oh! Well let’s look for them. (Finds some under one of the couch

cushions. It has a pink, fuzzy ball on the key chain.) Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?",28
Rachel," (chasing after him) Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?",10
Rachel," Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.",15
Rachel, You just don’t look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.,11
Rachel," Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just—I meant y’know are

you still a ‘We’ or are you just ‘You?’",22
Rachel, (sympathetic) Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?,10
Rachel, Ohh. (She touches his arm for support and likes what she feels) Ooh!,13
Monica," (looks at the drawing) Hmm, well, that's 

very flattering. Yeah, but it'd be great if you could draw me with some clothes 

and, y'know, a head. ",26
Joey, Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.,12
Chandler," Damn those robots, they’re supposed to be our faithful

servants!",10
Joey," Anyway, it wasn’t the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah,

he doesn’t like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was

reaching for one! Ohh!",32
Joey," I may have to, I hate to do it, but I’m the star! Y’know?

There’s a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. (His cell phone

rings) Excuse me. (Answers it, on phone) Joey Tribbiani. ",39
Ross, (coming out of the bedroom) Oh! Oh my God! I didn’t even see you!,14
Rachel," Well, y’know he lost his keys so he was looking for them…",12
Rachel," No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y’know, for like two hours,

and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.",28
Rachel," Ross, what’s the big deal? So I kissed the guy!",10
Rachel," Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let’s face it, so far

the guy’s not lovin’ ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We

can all go out to dinner, y’know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very

successful lawyer!",53
Joey," Apparently, there’s like a million guys out there that can play Mac,

and there’s only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn’t know

he could get me fired! What am I going to do?",39
Joey," Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.",11
Monica," No sweetie, you’ve got to win over the guy that controls

C.H.E.E.S.E.! You’ve got to kiss some serious robot ass!",20
Joey," That’s not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm

tomorrow I’m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. (Starts to leave, but

stops and turns to Phoebe.) Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.

(Exits.)",49
Chandler," So do you think uh, Joey’s more charming than me?",10
Monica, Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side.,10
Chandler," Yeah, you wish. (Stops to think about it and gets depressed.)",11
Phoebe, I’m not writing about you! I’m writing about other people.,10
Monica," Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I’ll just write about Phyllis!

Hmm!",13
Monica, (writing on a piece of paper) Phyllis is sitting in a chair.,12
Phoebe," Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!",11
Joey," Morning! Hey, how’s my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!

(Pats C.H.E.E.S.E. on the head.)",16
Joey," Okay! (He yanks his hand away.) All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level

with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even

have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second

chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! (He grabs C.H.E.E.S.E.’s arm and pulls

it off at the elbow.) Ah-ah!! (Wayne is shocked.) Okay, that’s why you didn’t

want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? (Hands Wayne the arm and he goes to fix it.

Meanwhile Joey starts to berate himself.) Stupid! I can’t believe it! God! (A very

beautiful woman walks by.) (To her) Hey, how you doin’? (He and her go over to talk

and Wayne looks on with envy.)",135
Rachel," So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly,

offered to take me.",18
Rachel," Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna

go to the bathroom.",15
Ross," (to Paul) Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So

it wasn’t as bad as-as…",21
Ross, Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.,13
Ross," No! No! Not—I don’t mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl!

I mean I-I have a son, who’s umm six and I still think of him as a baby.",30
Ross," Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just

so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I’m sure you are with your

wife! (Realizes) Oh, I’m sorry! (To Elizabeth) It’s unbelievable!",41
Rachel," Oh we were, but that was just a (pause as the audience reacts), I mean

that was just a big drunken mistake.",22
Monica," Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.",11
Chandler," The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at

seven, not at six.",19
Monica," Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this,

""Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!""",20
Phoebe," Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.",10
Phoebe," Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it’s my book to the

rescue, huh? (Reading her book) Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears

things up.",27
Phoebe, I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.,14
Chandler," Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are

the queen of everything.",17
Chandler," (To Monica) I told you I should not wear this color. (He’s

wearing a reddish-orange sweater.)",16
Phoebe," (reading from her book) Mon… (Pause as she restarts) Marcia and

Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they’re

supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it’s at seven.",34
Monica, Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!,12
Phoebe, (writing in her book) Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.,11
Chandler, Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?,11
Joey, Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.,10
Joey," Yeah? Well, I don’t want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined

my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. (They shake hands.)",25
Joey," Oh wow Wayne, it’s not really something you can teach y’know?

It’s pretty much something you’re born with if you—(Off Chandler’s

look)—You-you can teach it! I’ll show you right how to do it.",33
Chandler," Yeah. You should see the woman I'm 

with, way out of my league. ",13
Joey," (chuckles) In fact, if you want, I can get 

you her. (Turns and nods 'no' to Chandler.) ",17
Rachel," I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each

marriage.",16
Rachel," Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a

lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me. (Everyone looks at

her, Ross not happily.) Maybe I have to pee again. (Gets up to try to use the bathroom.)",50
Ross," Y’know what? I-I-I… I-I have had enough of this! Y’know,

I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but

respect! So if-if you’ve got a problem with me, frankly…",36
Ross," Well if it doesn’t matter to her, it doesn’t matter to me! (to

Paul) Still not yelling!",17
Ross," That’s okay, I’m not so crazy about myself right now either.",11
Rachel," (returning) Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how

nice Ross is!",13
Joey," You got it! And the rabbi’s beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch

C.H.E.E.S.E.! (Pauses as he waits for C.H.E.E.S.E.’s next line.) It’s your line

C.H.E.E.S.E.! (Suddenly C.H.E.E.S.E. goes crazy and starts flinging it’s arms and

advancing on Joey behind the desk.) Wayne! Wayne!!",42
Phoebe," Well it’s just—it’s one of those situations that I just

hate. Y’know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at

the Morgan Chase museum.",28
Joey, (nodding knowingly) Now you’re thinking you gotta sleep with him.,10
Phoebe," No! No! It’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six

of us!",16
Phoebe," It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed

with video games and free sandwiches.",15
Joey," Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich

museum this weekend!",16
Ross, Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.,13
Monica, I mean think about all the money that you’re gonna make!,11
Ross," No, no, that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on, let it go,

y’know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father, so ah,

he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested in

fossils, huh?",44
Rachel," I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in

fossils.",15
Ross," Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings

(Paul enters) in his ear. ",19
Ross," Oh, come on you guys; that’s funny! Y’know? Because he’s

need—he’s got like a hearing aide y’know, ‘cause-‘cause

y’know, ‘cause he’s all old, and… ",24
Ross," But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think

there’s really anything you can do about it.",20
Phoebe," Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of

fame! Eek!",17
Joey," He's got all the big actors. I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi

would just be crackin’ up about something… Then I get fired off of Days Of

Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he’s just laughing at me. Look at him, that

smug Belushi bastard, I’ll…",58
Phoebe," (gasps) Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you

next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. (Giggles) Yeah I know; we’d be great

together!",32
Joey," Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! (The dry cleaner doesn’t remember)

Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? (Holds his picture up in front of his face.)

Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I’m ready to go back up on the wall I’m the star of a

new TV show.",47
Joey," Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? (Walks away)",11
Phoebe," So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer’s clothes here? Maybe?

Just ones that haven’t been cleaned yet? ",20
Rachel," Oh, wait yes, but I can’t eat too much. Paul is taking me out to

dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.",25
Phoebe," Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he’s gonna tell you that he’s

gay?",14
Phoebe," No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?",11
Monica," This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I

wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!

(Points to both places.) I mean you’d have the ceremony under this big beautiful

arch. (The arch at the entrance to the room.) ",48
Rachel," Oh sorry didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just such a beautiful

space; do you do a lot of weddings here?",20
Rachel," Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list",11
Monica," What?! Are you crazy?! I’m not getting married! I’m not even

engaged.",12
Phoebe," Yeah, but there’s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged

in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That’s

four years. Chandler’s not gonna wait that long. He’s gonna find somebody else,

y’know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list. (Rachel agrees.)",55
Rachel," Yeah hon, it can’t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two

years if you’re not engaged you just don’t use it.",25
Monica," Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.",14
Phoebe," I don’t know, I don’t have anyone right now. Y’know?",10
Phoebe, Don’t feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn’t gay.,12
Joey," (entering) Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?",11
Joey," All right, let’s get me back up there! (Holds out his picture.)",12
Joey," Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the

Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them!

That-that-that’s offensive to Russians.",30
Ross," Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not

her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes—Do-do you want to make out?",30
Ross," Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.",11
Ross," No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.",12
Ross," (loudly) Why?! Are there like bears or something?! (Looks around and then

sees that Elizabeth is shaking her head no and realizes what Elizabeth meant.) Ohh. Oh,

protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot. I 

can't believe I brought two cans of bug spray and forgot that. ",46
Rachel," (from another room) Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a

beautiful house.",16
Chandler," Hey Joe. (Joey grabs a bunch of coats 

off the coat-rack and takes off.)  Everybody's gotta be doing something.",19
Chandler," (on machine) You’ve reached Monica and Chandler’s, if

you’re listening to this message, we’re probably screening. (to himself) Yeah we

are.",21
Chandler," (on phone) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (Listens)

Yes, the groom—No! Not the groom!!",17
Rachel," I feel like we’re the only two people in the world. (She sets down

her wine class, picks up a walnut, and knocks another one on the floor.) Oops. Sorry. (She

reaches down to pick it up and Ross hands it to her. Ross is hiding under the couch and

causes Rachel to scream.)",54
Rachel," No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I—would

you—actually, would you go check on that?",16
Rachel," Okay. (After Paul leaves Rachel drops to the floor to confront Ross.)

What?! What are you doing here?!",18
Rachel," Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! (Ross gets up and heads for the

kitchen.) No! Not in there! He’s in there! (She points Ross to the door next to the

kitchen.)",33
Rachel," Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to

the closed garage.",15
Rachel, Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?,13
Rachel," Well, why do y’know go in that room (points to the room Ross is in)

and do your homework?",19
Rachel," That’s your, that’s your dad’s bedroom. (Yelling)

That’s your dad’s bedroom!",11
Rachel," Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!",11
Monica," What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!",10
Chandler," (angrily) Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask! (He

storms out.)",16
Monica," Oh please, he didn’t hear it! He didn’t hear it!!",10
Chandler," (on machine) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (The

machine beeps off.)",14
Joey," Uh yeah, where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up

on the wall?",14
Joey," Oh, you’re kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him

that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I’m an actor;

I’m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.",38
Joey," Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? (Pause) You’re

the other one right? (She thinks about it for a second and nods yes.)",27
Rachel," Really? Okay. Okay, I-I’ll go upstairs. (to Paul) If-if you get me

something from the car.",16
Rachel," (yelling) So you’re gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and

that’s where everybody’s gonna be!",18
Monica," The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation

and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! (Phoebe gasps.) I know! How bad

is this?!",32
Phoebe," Well for the regular guy, it’s bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!",12
Monica," I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can’t find him

anywhere!",15
Monica," Well, I’m never gonna listen to you again, that’s for sure!

(Mimicking her.) ""Y’know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?""",26
Joey," Did she put my picture up? You kidding, 

after the date we had. I wouldn't be surprised if she put 10 of my pictures up 

there. Except for the fact that I only gave her one. I don't know where she'd 

get the other nine.",45
Phoebe," Oh! Here it is! (Noticing it next to the door.) Ooh, Joey! Why did you

sign it, ""Son of a bitch?"" (Son of a bitch is written across the entire

picture.)",31
Joey," Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I—Hey! I did not go out with your wife!

(The same woman from before enters.) Okay? I went out with her! (Points at her.)",25
Joey," (nervously) Um-um-um, I'm not pointing to 

her, no. I'm pointing at-at her. (To a picture off screen) ""Zelda McMurray."" Who 

the hell--? How did she get up there?! ",28
Ross," Elizabeth! (He opens one of the bed stands that he has curled himself up

into.) Okay. Okay. (She helps him out.) I’m gonna go out this window. (Points to the

window next to him.) I’ll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you’re

going home, okay?",48
Rachel," (yelling from the living room) Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don’t go in

there! Don’t go in there! I need another soda!",20
Rachel, Oh my God Ross! What in heaven’s name are you doing here?,12
Ross, (to Elizabeth) And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.,12
Ross," All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you

and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy. (Paul just looks at him.)",36
Ross," And I too am just a love machine. (Hums a little bit and mimics

Paul’s flexing.)",16
Monica," (going over to him) I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.",11
Chandler," I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named

Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (Does one of

those Chandler noises.)",31
Monica," Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names

down for fun! I mean, what’s the harm in that?",23
Monica," Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe

and Rachel…",13
Chandler," Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me

were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who

are available by the way!",33
Monica," It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because

it doesn’t.",14
Chandler," Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that

I’m just not ready…",15
Monica," I’m gonna go tell Joey that (laughs) that you’re back. I was

really worried about you. And y'know that guy that never 

delivered his burrito? He thought there was some sort of connection. (Exits.)",34
Phoebe, I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you!,10
Joey," Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.",14
Joey," No! No, I quit a long time ago. (Pause) Did I forget to you that one?

I’m sorry.",18
Chandler," Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I

can’t figure this out! It’s so hard! Should I get her a (turning to each page)

Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah! Paper cut!",39
Chandler," No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want

Monica to find out.",16
Chandler," Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best

friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.",25
Phoebe," Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t

been on the toilet.",17
Phoebe," Now let me see. Is there such a thing as 

a Monica cut? Because that would be your best bet. ",20
Ross," Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.",12
Joey," Oh, I’m sorry. You wanna bite? (Holds his piece out for him.)",12
Rachel," Good. Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy. Y’know, I

wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.",23
Phoebe," That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles

that won’t open.",18
Rachel," So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his

head against a table?",19
Phoebe," No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of

someone.",15
Ross," Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off

before?",14
Phoebe," I didn’t do it! It was Chandler! He’s… He’s mad at

you!",12
Phoebe," Come on Ross, you’re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.",10
Ross," Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to that

Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?",21
Phoebe, Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for?,12
Ross," Well, if he’s angry, he really shouldn’t just cover it up. I-I

wish he would just tell me the truth.",20
Phoebe," Oh, if that’s what you want you then you really should run his head

under hot water and bang his head against a table.",24
Rachel," Yeah that’s great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me

about your day.",17
Rachel," Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?",12
Rachel," Yeah that’s great Paul, but y’know I wanna know

what—(Puts her hands on his shoulders)—Wow, those are really great! I just wanna

know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y’know they say that

still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.",45
Rachel," No Paul, I don’t know anything about you! Y’know, like-like

your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!",17
Rachel," Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that’s always a painful

time! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand

in warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.",42
Rachel," Well, you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway,

umm… The rest of you life, y’know? Any regrets?",20
Rachel," All right Paul, I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me

something. Anything!",16
Rachel," That’s-that’s great! See? I already feel like I know you a

little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let’s go. (Gets up to

leave, but Paul doesn’t move.)",33
Rachel," Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really

great that-that y’know, you shared your feelings. It’s really, it’s

beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?",35
Rachel," What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao

Chicken!",13
Rachel," My God, I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! I

wouldn’t do that!",16
Chandler," Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we’ve been too and

I can’t find the perfect ring! (Goes over to another display counter and starts

pointing at rings.) Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! (Notices that one of the jewelers is

watching him.) It’s a beautiful selection. (The jeweler walks away slowly.)",53
Phoebe," Okay, so maybe you don’t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do

something different. Y’know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y’know?

Or an engagement tiara? Or—ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up

from the display in the corner.",43
Chandler," Y’know, I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this.",12
Phoebe," Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this

gorgeous piece of weaponry?",18
Chandler," Yeah, I’m gonna stick with the ring. (Goes to another display

counter.) Oh, this one’s nice! (Pointing to another ring.) I like this one! Sir? Uh,

kind sir? Can I see this one?",33
Phoebe," (coming over after returning the musket) Wait a minute, no, this is,

this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from

here on out.",34
Chandler," Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.",10
Chandler," Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and ask

me to marry you?",18
Chandler," (choking up) Oh my God that’s it, that’s the ring! How much

is it?",14
Phoebe," Chandler, I-I will handle this! (To the jeweler) How much is it?",12
Chandler," Uh, credit card. (Reaches for it then realizes) Oh no! No-no, but I

left my credit card with Joey. (To Phoebe) Okay, I’ll go get it. You guard the ring.",30
Chandler," Oh, I gave it to him to buy some 

Knicks tickets.  Then the jerk didn't even invite me to the game! But I'm 

over it! Whatever! (exits)",27
Phoebe," Okay. (To the jeweler) Listen, I’m sorry about before. Do you have

anything her for $10.",16
Ross," Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?",10
Ross," Okay. Well, apparently Chandler’s angry at us for not getting him a

ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.",22
Joey," Oh, we’re supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always

mooching off of us!",17
Ross," Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up,

y’know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and

invite him.",30
Joey, Oh wow that’s a great idea! And I still have his credit card.,13
Joey," Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. (Hands Gunther

Chandler’s card.) Y’know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just—I don’t get

Chandler. Y’know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don’t get

all upset.",40
Joey," That's impossible! Let me see it. (Gunther 

hands it back.) (Joey looks at it.) Oh, this one's mine. (Grabs Chandler's out 

of his pocket and hands it to Gunther.) Here you go. ",32
Rachel," Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault;

I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn’t know that I was gonna unleash this-this

weepy, clingy, moist monster!",36
Monica," Y’know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one

of them is sex.",19
Monica," I don’t know, I’ve never had to use the other one. I’m

just saying y’know, if we’re having sex, he’s not gonna be talking.",24
Rachel," Oh that’s right. You’re the talker. (They both reflect on that

briefly) Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy

him some more tissues.",34
Phoebe," Okay umm, I’d also like to try on the tiara. (The male jeweler

hands it to her.) Oh yeah. Okay. (Puts it on.) (To the jeweler) What do you think, too

much?",32
Phoebe," Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. (He

hands it to her and Phoebe poses in front of one of those small mirrors.) Something’s

missing. It’s not… Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.",44
Phoebe," Oh my God!! (She runs after him, but sets of the security system, which

locks the store’s door and brings down a set of bars behind her, caging her in.) No!

What?! Help me! Let me out! Now! (Points the musket at them.)",43
Chandler, No. How are ya Paul? (Starts to look for his credit card.),12
Chandler," Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.",11
Chandler," Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. (Paul rushes over and hugs

Chandler tightly.) Oh hey! There you go. (The hug continues.) Okay. (The hug continues.)",28
Joey," Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! (Motions to Chandler, ""What’s going

on?"") Hi, Paul is it? (Paul nods yes and still hugging Joey.)",18
Joey," Yes, it’s in my… In…in my pocket. (Paul hasn’t dropped

him yet.) (Chandler starts to reach for his front pocket.) My back pocket! My back pocket!",26
Joey, Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.,12
Joey," Come on! It’ll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and… Paul

probably…",12
Chandler," Look, I don't have time for this okay! 

I gotta go. (Exits)",12
Joey," Yeah, I know. (Both him and Paul start to 

cry.)",10
Phoebe," Chandler, I found the perfect ring. (Holding it out for her.)",11
Chandler," Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go with

the one I picked first.",16
Phoebe," Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It’s over!",12
Phoebe," Some guy bought it. I’m sorry. I tired to stop it but they (points

to the jeweler) put me in jail!",21
Phoebe," I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monica

never even saw the other ring.",17
Chandler, Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.,14
Ross," I can’t believe it. (Pause) Can I tell you something? I’m a

little mad at him now.",17
Ross," Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry,

well maybe we don’t talk to him at all!",21
Joey," From now on, it’s gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. (They shake

hands.) Okay! We’re gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.",23
Ross," (stares at Joey) What?! Ohh, you think you 

and Chandler were closer than me and Chandler? ",16
Joey," Oh-oh-oh. Hey-hey-hey, don't get angry.  

We turn on each other, he wins. (They both shake hands.) ",16
Rachel," Ah that’s great. No actually that’s… (In a sexy voice)

That’s great! That’s really great! Y’know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean

writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.",31
Rachel," Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, (sits on the

counter and buttons her sweater to show some cleavage) get a little more comfortable here.

Wait, now wait a second, this isn’t too revealing is it?",42
Rachel," I don’t care about the little dude! I can’t! I cannot listen

to anymore of this! Y’know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a

mental health professional! And then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do

you know how much money I could’ve made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know

when I figured that out? While you were talking!",69
Rachel," Oh… I’m sorry. I… I-I don’t mean—I didn’t

mean to stifle you. I… This is all just a little overwhelming.",20
Rachel," I’m so glad, I’m so glad you shared. (Feeling his shoulder.)

And I’m glad that you’re done. What do you say we umm… (Nods in the

direction of the bedroom.)",30
Chandler," I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball

machine looking ring!",16
Phoebe," It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s a

beautiful ring!",12
Chandler," No, it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see

Monica’s face when I gave it to her, y’know? And I could see her saying yes.

When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then

I can see my own eye. (Does so and laughs.) Look, this is the most important thing

I’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect.",79
Phoebe," Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back.

‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we

can get him to trade rings or something.",39
Phoebe, Well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring.,10
Chandler," (is about to say something)...I'd love 

to know how you got from rainbow to L'Espace. ",15
Phoebe," (thinks about it) No you wouldn't.  

You don't wanna get in here. (Points to her head.) ",16
Chandler," Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her

finger.",14
Phoebe," Oh, okay. (Walks over to him.) Excuse me sir? Could you come with me

please? You have a phone call.",20
Chandler," (to him) Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store,

the ring you’re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I’m

gonna need to have that back. (The guy isn’t sure.) But, in exchange I’m willing

to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (Looking at the ring.) Ew.",58
Chandler," No-no! This is my fiancée (Phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring.

You don’t want to break her heart now do you?",24
Phoebe," Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?",10
Phoebe," Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m not

buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all

eternity…",32
Chandler," Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (To his girlfriend) And you

are about to marry a wonderful man! (She stunned and he’s horrified.) Hey! I’m

marrying a dead woman!",29
Chandler," Guys? (They ignore him.) I’ve got something important to tell ya.

(Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over to

try and watch the TV, Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause) I’m gonna ask Monica to

marry me.",46
Joey, (To Ross) I think we gotta end the freeze out.,10
Ross," You-you’re gonna get married?! I mean… We’re gonna be

brothers-in-law! (They hug.)",12
Chandler," Okay! (They hug.) I was gonna wait ‘til uh, it was official

y’know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you’re my best

friends.",30
Ross," Me too! I was planning on having a 

conversation with you about your intentions. ",14
Rachel," (who has just entered) Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one

cry baby, I’ll dump you too!",19
Rachel," Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! (Hugs him.) You guys are gonna be so

happy!",17
Joey," (holding an empty tissue box) Where’s all the tissues?! (Throws the

box down in disgust.)",15
Chandler," Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can

understand that, right? (Ross and Joey look at each other and go back to watching the game

on TV.) Guys? Guys? (Walks in front of them again.)",41
Phoebe,"  Yeah, you should 

know. You've bought like a billion of them. ",11
Ross," Ahh, humor based on my pain. 

(Imitates a sarcastic laugh.)",10
Rachel,"  You know what's 

funny? Of all of your wives, I'm the only one who never got a ring. ",18
Rachel," No, but, y'know, it would 

have been nice to have a little memento of our married time together. Something 

other than the divorce papers and the hangover. ",27
Phoebe," Ross is obviously not going 

to get you a ring. But ask for a musket. Ask for a musket! ",19
Ross," (to Rachel) Hey, when we were 

married do you know what I never got? Umm....sex. ",15
Rachel," (scoffs) Well, yeah. No 

ring, no sex. Big surprise. (Ross laughs a little.)",13
Phoebe," (to Ross) Get me a musket 

and we'll talk. (Ross raises one of his eyebrows as if he was intrigued.)",20
Chandler," Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked

my neck!!",10
Monica," Oh, my mom called, they’re gonna run our

engagement announcement in the local paper, so we’re looking

for a good picture of us.",23
Chandler," No, there are great pictures of you standing

next to a guy who’s going like this… (Makes what can

only be described as a toothy frown. Henceforth, this shall be

known as The Face.)",34
Phoebe," Oh my God! That’s the creep that

you’re with at the Statue of Liberty.",14
Chandler," I don’t know what it is, I just

can’t take a good picture.",13
Phoebe," Hey, why don’t you guys go, get portraits

done by a professional photographer.",13
Monica," That’s a good idea! I bet they have one of

those wind machines! Y’know… (Does the whole hair

blowing in the wind model type poses.)",25
Phoebe," Yeah that’s great! Next to that, Chandler

won’t look so stupid.",11
Chandler," All right, but I should warn you, I’m

not going. I’m going. (Does The Face while saying that last

part.)",20
Chandler," And those guys were this (Doing the

standard ""This Close"" gesture) close to lettin’ us

play this time too.",19
Ross," Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we

call him Hums While He Pees.",15
Phoebe," (returning) Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees

just asked me out!",12
Phoebe," He is! But he’s getting

divorced—Ross! Maybe you know him.",10
Rachel," Phoebe, if this guy’s going through a

divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?",20
Rachel," Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the

office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.",21
Chandler," Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why

would you hire him? I mean y’know you can’t date him

right?",22
Rachel," Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we

made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me

his work wife.",27
Ross," Soon he’ll be able to call you, that lady he

knew who got fired.",14
Rachel," I am not gonna get fired, because I’m not

gonna act on it.",13
Phoebe," So you wouldn’t mind if he was dating

someone else?",10
Rachel," Why? Is he? He is! Isn’t he? He’s

dating that slut in marketing!",13
Ross, I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.,10
Rachel," Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost

reports come in?",13
Rachel," Oh, great could you make me four copies of

those?",10
Rachel," (startled) Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what’s

up? I’m just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get

some stuff to put in my backpack. Y’know, like dried fruit

and granola and stuff. What’s up? (She has put on the

backpack.)",43
Rachel, Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?,10
Rachel," Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This

ain’t a locker room, okay? But, y’know I remember him

saying that-that he had plans tonight.",22
Rachel," Yeah Melissa, I don’t want to be known as

the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.",19
Monica," Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can

do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.",17
Monica," Yeah! (They turn to the camera, and Chandler

does The Face again.) All right, maybe you don’t have to

smile. Let’s try something else. Let’s try umm, try

looking sexy.",30
Chandler," Okay. (You’ll have to see it, I

can’t describe the face he makes, but it isn’t good.)",17
Joey," Uhh, well I’ve got an audition down the

street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt.

(Removes his hand to reveal a huge sauce stain.) You got an extra

one?",34
Joey," Great. (He doesn’t like it.) You got

anything that’s not Ralph Lauren?",12
Rachel," How would you feel about taking out my

assistant Tag? I’ll pay.",12
Joey," Huh, Rach I got to say it’s gonna take a lot

of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.",24
Rachel," I’m not asking you to go on a date

with him!",11
Rachel," Joey, just-just he-he’s new in town and I

know he doesn’t have any guy friends. Just take him to like

a ball game or something. I’ll really appreciate it.",29
Joey," Okay. (He grabs a jelly donut, takes a bite, and

guess what he spills all over himself. He tries to clean it up

and smears it all over the shirt.Since the

jam is red he asks...) You got a red

shirt?",41
Monica," I know. Let’s try a look…of far

off…wonderment. Okay, we’ll-we’ll gaze into our

future and we’ll think about our marriage and the days to

come. (Chandler is still not getting it.) Chandler! What is the

matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say

""Geller and Bing to be married,"" not ""Local woman

saves drowning moron!"" (The photographer laughs.) Hey!

Don’t laugh at him! He’s my drowning moron!",71
Ross," I like this one. (Points to it.) It seems to say,

""I love you and that’s why I have to kill you.""",22
Monica," They can’t all be bad. (To Chandler) Find

the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.",20
Chandler," Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why

did you ever sleep with me?",15
Phoebe," Yeah, I… Well y’know I-I mean I

missed the-the semi-finals, so I’d just be lost.",15
Phoebe," Okay, I know. Hold on. (She walks over to the

couch.) Hey Ross?",13
Phoebe," Yeah, umm that’s Whitney (Points),

Kyle’s ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can

y’know divert her so that we can slip out?",25
Phoebe," Well okay but I have two tickets to the

ballroom dance finals. (She holds up the tickets that Kyle gave

her.)",21
Ross," Look, I don’t think so Pheebs. (Pause) All

right, I’ll do it. But just because you’re a friend.

(Grabs the tickets and heads to divert Whitney.)",26
Phoebe," All right, well I just wanted to say thank you

though for diverting Kyle’s ex. ",15
Phoebe," (To Ross) Kyle’s ex-wife? You were

supposed to divert her not date her!",13
Ross," (opens the door and to Whitney) Hi! I’m

sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman,

who by the way did not spend the night.",31
Ross," Okay. (Closes the door.) (To Phoebe) I did

divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?",19
Ross," Yes! That’s where we realized we were both

super cool people!",11
Phoebe," Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me

some really bad stuff about her.",14
Phoebe," Like she’s really mean, and she’s

over critical, and-and—No! She will paint a room a really

bright color without even checking with you!",23
Ross," Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast

I’ll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.",19
Ross," Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of

course her ex-husband’s gonna say that stuff. Now, if

you’ll excuse me…",21
Rachel," (Pretending to

be really mad and annoyed) Tag is not here! My God! Do you people

have nothing better to do than to traipse into my office and gawk

at my assistant? ",32
Rachel," Oh my God,I'm

so sorry. Yes, of course. (Gives her money) Just take it all.

Take it all.Please, give my best to Emily.",23
Rachel," Yeah, no, i

meant....(small pause)...the other one that you said. (Emily

exits)",12
Rachel," Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with

Joey last night?",14
Rachel," That’s great! Wow man, so Joey

must’ve really taught you some stuff huh?",13
Joey," See? That’s a great smile! Easy. Natural.

Now, pretend I have a camera. (Chandler immediately does The

Face.) You’re changing it!",21
Joey," All right, all right, all right, all right, you

wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?",19
Joey," Okay, first—first of all, you want to make

it look spontaneous. I look down (Looks down), look down, keep

looking down; then I look up. (Looks up and smiles.) See? All

right, now you try. Look down (Chandler looks down), you’re

looking down, keep looking down…",46
Rachel," So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last

night.",11
Rachel," Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all

Joey.",12
Joey," Hey well, you can’t teach someone to be good

with women. Y’know, that’s why I never had any luck

with Chandler.",21
Rachel," All right, would-would you mind just not going

out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all

these women, it’s just—And I know he’s my

assistant and I can’t date him—but it just bothers me,

all right?!",42
Joey," Hey! No-no-no-no, you can’t take him away

from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!",20
Rachel," All right, will you, will you at least tell him

how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!",21
Rachel," I just don’t want him to meet anybody

until I am over my crush—And I will get over it.

It’s-it’s not like I love him, it’s just physical!

But—I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean

hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!",52
Chandler," Did you have a crush on me, when you first

met me?",12
Rachel," Yeah. Sure. (Joey nods his head questioningly

and Rachel nods no.)",11
Chandler," Can you people not see me?! (He waves his

arms around to get their attention.)",15
Rachel," Oh, come on! I’ll give you ten free Ralph

Lauren shirts.",11
Joey," One! (Pause.) No ten! You said ten! You

can’t take that back!",12
Joey," I don’t know. You uh, you got something for

me?",10
Joey," Ten. Okay. Now Tag there’s such a thing as

to many women.",12
Monica," (to the photographer) How

much would it cost to get big fan in here? (seeing

Chandler approach) Hey! There you are!",21
Chandler," Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he

gave me an antihistamine.",15
Chandler," Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway

and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!",19
Chandler," I don’t know, but don’t worry,

don’t worry, because I know how to take a picture now. (They

get ready) Okay, see? Look down (Looks down), look down, look

down… (He falls asleep.)",33
Phoebe," So, how are things going with crazy? Has she

cooked your rabbit yet?",13
Ross," Listen, you are hearing one side of the

story, okay—and F.Y.I she must’ve shown Kyle over 30

paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to

each one was, ""I don’t give a tiny rat’s

ass.""",38
Phoebe," Yeah well, maybe she should’ve spent a

little less time decorating and a little more time in the

bedroom.",19
Ross," Well, I don’t think we are gonna have

that problem, but maybe that’s just because I am not

emotionally unavailable!",20
Phoebe," Well, maybe he wouldn’t be she didn’t

bring the office home every night!",13
Ross," Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do

with her life!",13
Phoebe," Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was

doing New Year’s Eve 1997.",13
Ross," (angrily) I knew you were gonna throw

that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and

she apologized! What more do you want?!!",26
Phoebe," (gets up and starts to leave) We want the last

six years back!!",13
Ross," So do we!! So do we!! (Ross notices a couple has

been staring at them.) I’m sorry you had to see that.",22
Rachel," Hi! (He hands her, her mail) Thanks, hey so uh

what’d you do last night?",15
Rachel," Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on,

you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y’know?",24
Rachel," (panics, turns around, picks up the phone, and

pretend to talk on it) Hello?! (Listens) Oh, yeah! (To Tag) This

is gonna be a while. Excuse me. (Tag leaves and she closes the

door behind him, disgustedly.) Yeah!",38
Phoebe," Oh, I’m sorry. Is that annoying? And

speaking about being selfish in bed, how’s Whitney?",15
Ross," Well maybe she wouldn’t have to be selfish

in bed if someone else knew where everything was!",17
Phoebe," What about her whining and her constant need

for attention?!",10
Ross," That’s all right, we-we don’t need you.

In fact, hey I’m over it already.",14
Phoebe," Yeah, and y’know what? I don’t give a

tiny rat’s ass.",11
Ross," (To Phoebe) I’m sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you

were, you were right about her. Y’know, she did try

to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.",30
Phoebe," Oh. Y’know, he hums while he does other

stuff to.",10
Phoebe," And y’know, even if they break up again,

you’d better not let him in your sad men’s club!",18
Phoebe," Potato, Potaato. (She’s pronounces potato

with the both the short and long As.)",13
Monica," Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the

paper!",11
Monica, Okay. (She opens it up and shows it to them.),10
Phoebe," You guys make a very attractive couple.

(The camera cuts to a shot of the picture and we see that Monica

is posing with Joey instead of Chandler.)",28
Monica," Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to

brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who

should be my maid of honor.",28
Rachel," Oh my God! This is it! (She and Phoebe hold

hands.) (To Phoebe) I really hope it’s you!",18
Monica," First of all um, I love you both so much and

you’re both so important to me…",17
Monica," Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could

come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for

each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine…",31
Monica," Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be

Rachel’s, that way we all get to do it once and no one would

get upset.",23
Phoebe," Yeah, I’ll do that. So who gets to be

yours?",10
Monica," (laughs) Well that’s the best part. Umm, you

guys get to decide!",12
Rachel," Well of course we will help you decide!

We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make

a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing (A woman at the table

behind them overhears Chandler’s name and starts listening

closer), my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people

that…",56
Phoebe," Aww, and good luck to you too! (To Monica and

Rachel) What a nice lady!",15
Joey," Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double

feature?",12
Chandler," (looking at the tape) Joey, this is Die

Hard 1 again.",11
Joey," Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die

Hard 2!",13
Chandler," No, see the thing is I want to get out of

here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody

bitch.",23
Phoebe," Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of

honor?",12
Rachel," Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I’m

just—Wait a minute. If I’m your maid of honor that

means you are Monica’s.",21
Phoebe," Because this one is now! And-and

it’s two of our best friends! Who knows what

you’re gonna marry!",18
Phoebe," (gasps) You wouldn’t! Okay look, Rachel I

know you really want to do this, but I-I’ve never been maid

of honor to anyone before! And I know you’ve done it at

least twice!",33
Phoebe," And no, oh please, oh please let me finish.

(Rachel stops talking.) Oh I guess that was it.",18
Rachel," Okay. Okay. It’s—since you’ve

never done it before you can be Monica’s made of honor.",15
Rachel," Better than Chandler. (Phoebe exhales as if to

say, ""Like what isn’t?"")",12
Joey," Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I’d

better go.",10
Joey," No! Never! Never! (Pause, then Joey wants to

shake Ross’s hand.) Bye.",12
Chandler," (To Monica)

Look honey, the nice people are chopping shallots.",10
Monica," If they chop enough of them

maybe they can open up that bikini shop!Yeah hey, a weird

thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard

that I was marrying you and-and then she…she wished me good

luck.",40
Chandler," Well do you

think she meant good luck taming the wild stallion?",12
Chandler," Well, is there any chance you were looking

into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?",16
Monica," Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in

college?",10
Chandler," No, no I only dated two girls in college,

both blonde, both not attractive… (Thinks a little while.)

Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs

a photo album.",35
Chandler," Well, let’s see… (Finding the

picture he wants.) Okay uh, is that her? (Pointing to the

picture.)",17
Chandler," (pause) No, we’re still together. Yeah

we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.",19
Chandler," Well, ‘cause she came back the third

summer and she’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow…",13
Monica, You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!,10
Chandler," Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long

time ago! Does she still feel bad?",16
Chandler," Well, you know what they say, elephants never

forget. (Monica is not amused by that statement.) Seriously, good

luck marrying me.",21
Joey," Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last

time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe

glares at him.)",23
Joey," Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should

do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how

you’d handle maid of honor type situations.",29
Joey," Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and

if I’m the best of the people they see, they give me the

part. They send you a script, you go to the

set, you rehearse, you have wardobe fittings and then you shoot

your part. It's great! But right after that, you are right back

down the street looking for work again. Right back where

you started! So I gotta say I don't think a career in

acting is the right choice for you two! ",88
Phoebe," Okay, so after this audition, who decides who

gets it?",10
Rachel," Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just

flip a coin?!",12
Rachel," Okay. Okay fine, y’know what? We will let

Ross and Joey decide. (Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.) Hiiiii,

Ross! Sweetie.",21
Ross," Wow, this cologne really is every bit as

good as Georgio. ",11
Joey," Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk

about before.",14
Joey," Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever

had!! ",13
Joey," Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever

had!",12
Ross, All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!,10
Monica," Chandler! (Knocks on the door.) Chandler! I

just figured out who you are!",13
Monica," Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth

grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he

said no. Do you know why?",29
Chandler," Because you kept talking to him while he was

trying to go to the bathroom?!",15
Monica," No! But because he thought I was to

faaaaa…. (Chandler emerges, without flushing by the way.)

And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did

in fifth grade! Y’know, I-I really think that you should

apologize to Julie.",45
Chandler," What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years

ago.",10
Monica," No, I know. But y’know what? It would make

me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.",17
Chandler," Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you;

this may make me a better person and that is not the man

you feel in love with! ",29
Monica," She probably

lives in the city. She was eating in that restaurant.",12
Chandler," I'll bet she was!!! (laughs

then Monica just looks at him and he suddenly stops laughing)

What is wrong with me?",21
Joey," Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to

work. We’re gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor

situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being

the highest.",35
Joey," No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t

know if I can do it! This means I’ll never get to sleep with

Joey!",26
Rachel," Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common.

Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the

anticipation and you just have to remember that you love

Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to

keep the gifts.",41
Joey," (out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing

on your own experience, I like that!",15
Joey," We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about

to say, ""I do"" when her drunk uncle starts yelling.

What do you do? Go!",23
Ross," (playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a

little girl, I remember that—(Phoebe screams and tackles

him)—Ooh!! Ow! Very good!",20
Rachel," Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the

middle of the ceremony!",14
Phoebe," Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of

Pheebs?!",12
Joey," Ladies, please,

please! Ok the next situation is for Rachel. The wedding is about

to start. You walk into the back room and you find Monica taking

a nap with Ross. (Ross lays down on the floor) I'll be Monica.

GO! ",41
Ross," Oh no no no! This situation is not

sanctioned! Now we are moving into the next one. Okay,

it is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.",30
Rachel," Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster’s Dictionary

defines marriage as… (Ross and Joey start writing.) Okay!!

Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm,

okay, uh… I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a

couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when

he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.",62
Rachel," Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I’ve

known them separately and I’ve known them together and-and

to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the

presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a

glass and holds it up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful

adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of

no two people better prepared for the journey.",77
Ross," Okay Phoebe, I guess you’re next (To Joey)

although I really don’t see the point.",15
Phoebe," Okay, I can’t believe that Monica and

Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day

with Rachel while we were showering together, naked. (Raises her

glass and drinks.)",30
Chandler," (she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing,

I, I guess you remember me.",14
Chandler," Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I

never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.",21
Chandler," You-you-you didn’t know that. (Pause as

she nods no.) Well, I guess my work here is done!",17
Phoebe," (to Ross and

Joey) Can I get you guys a drink while you tabulate?",14
Joey," All right, well first of all I would like to say

that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of

yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this

competition there are no losers. Well, except for

Rachel—Damnit!",43
Rachel," Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm, I wonder

where I’ve heard that before.)",14
Rachel," No! Y’know what? No! No! You thing was so

stupid anyway, this was ridiculous—We’re gonna flip a

coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips the coin.) Heads!

(Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)",35
Rachel," Well y’know what? I hope Monica forgives

you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley

shower! (Runs out.)",20
Phoebe," (running after her) Rach, it’s gonna be

okay! (To Ross and Joey) You guys are the best!",17
Joey," Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out

of me.",13
Joey," Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs

and taking a little nap on my couch. (Raises his eyebrows,

questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.) ",29
Joey," No reason, I’m just saying that uh…

That’s where I’ll be. ",11
Chandler," As bad as that went I actually enjoyed

myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the

stupid things I do.",24
Monica," Why don’t you just stop doing stupid

things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.",14
Monica," Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat

again?",12
Monica," Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much

weight could she have gained?",14
Monica," In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her

family! That’s not the point.",15
Chandler," Look I know it was a stupid reason to break

up with somebody, but I was 15!",17
Monica," Well… That’s not the only time this

was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with

us? You called me fat.",23
Chandler," Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was

totally different.",10
Chandler," You were not supposed to hear that! I said

that behind you back!",13
Monica," What if I have babies, okay? I mean I’m

gonna look different. I’m okay with that, but I’m not

sure that you are!",23
Chandler," Look you have to realize I don’t think

of you as a thin, beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See

this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what

I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.

",46
Chandler," So you can balloon up or you can shrink down

and I will still love you.",16
Rachel," Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really

sorry I was a baby.",13
Phoebe," That’s ridiculous Rachel, we were all

babies once. (Rachel looks at her.) Oh, you mean today.",16
Rachel," Yeah. Yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to

win. And-and y’know I was thinking about it, if-if

you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to be

yours.",28
Rachel," Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got

engaged I started putting some stuff together, y’know just

in case…",19
Rachel," Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica

loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of

one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (Shows Phoebe the

picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird

because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here’s a little

purse that I found. (Hands her the purse) Y’know I just

thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.",78
Rachel," And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know

‘cause, people cry at weddings. (Starting to cry.) I’m

just gonna grab a couple of these.",21
Rachel," Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was

the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to

be Monica’s something borrowed and it’s blue. (Starts

to cry again.) Yeah…",37
Phoebe," Y’know Rach, I think that, I think you

should be Monica’s made of honor.",14
Phoebe," Its fine. I mean, this is something that

you’ve been thinking about since you were what, 14?

(She’s referring to the Halloween picture.)",23
Phoebe," Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be

your maid of honor.",13
Rachel," Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she’s gonna

be yours. (Phoebe gets suddenly scared.)",14
Joey," (reacting first by jumping up) Dude! What the

hell are you doing?! God! (Heads for his room leaving Ross.)",19
Rachel," Well, y’know I was thinking of moving the

couch over here.",11
Rachel," So that there will be a decent place for me to

sit.",12
Rachel," And your lap does not count! Okay? Come

on help me move this.",13
Joey," The big deal is that it is the exact equal

distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it’s at the

perfect angle so you don’t get any glare coming of off

Stevie.",33
Rachel," No! (Joey sets his beer and bag of chips down

and heads into his room.) Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita,

us chichas got to stick together! (She tries pulling on the back

of the chair, until the hinge breaks and the back falls off.) You

bitch!",49
Ross," Hey, y’know

what’s weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce

me to people you’re gonna have to say, ""This is my

brother-in-law Ross."" Not, ""My friend Ross,""

""brother-in-law Ross."" That’s weird isn’t it?",35
Monica," (entering, carrying a newspaper) Hey Ross! So,

I was checking out the uh, real estate section…",16
Ross," Oh, it looks like mom and dad’s house. Oh,

it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the

window in the attic is…Oh my God!!",31
Monica," I can’t believe mom and dad are selling

the house!",10
Phoebe," I can’t believe I still don’t know

what happened to the window in the attic!",15
Ross," (on phone) Uh, hello dad!

Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! (Listens) Yes

we’re surprised! (Listens) Who did you leave a message with?",27
Joey," I told you not to move it!

Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and

you said don’t, and I did it anyway and her head fell

off?",34
Rachel," Okay, come on—Joey, I’ll buy you a

new one! All right? We’ll go down to the store right now and

we’ll-we’ll get you a new chair.",26
Joey," (slowly turning and glaring at her) She’s

not even cold yet!",11
Rachel," But don’t you think Rosita would’ve

wanted you to move on? I mean y’know, she did always

put…your comfort first.",20
Joey," Yeah, I… (Shuts off

the TV.) I don’t want Stevie to see her like this.",15
Ross," I can’t believe we have to say goodbye to

the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger’s gonna be

living in my room.",24
Monica," Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it

as a shrine to you, it’s time the velvet ropes came down.",22
Monica," Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20

minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack

of Victoria’s Secret catalogues, not a gym!",31
Ross," I was their first born! They thought she was

barren! It’s not my fault.",14
Phoebe," Well okay, it’s already February and

I’ve only given two massages and they were both the worst

tippers in the world!",21
Ross," Hey, y’know if you want to pick up some

extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing

telemarketing.",20
Monica," Oh that’s a

great idea. You’re really good on the phone.",11
Phoebe," Yeah and yeah, and

it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had.

Y’know, I probably wouldn’t have to say spank as much.

(Monica and Ross are shocked.) ",31
Phoebe," Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love

my office.",13
Phoebe," Oh okay. Umm, all right. (Picks up the phone

and starts reading from the script.) Hi, this is Phoebe from

Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager

please?",31
Phoebe," Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about

your toner needs.",13
Phoebe," Oh okay, well I’m sorry to bother you.

Bye-bye. (Hangs up the phone.) Yeah you’re right, this is

easy.",19
Phoebe," Oh well, all right…um, no offense, but you

were kind of rude.",12
Phoebe," No. (Pause) Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one

question. What is toner?",15
Chandler," Joey! Joe! (Sees that he’s not here and

starts investigating. He picks up the bag of chips.) Full bag.

(He picks up the beer.) Beer’s still cold. Something terrible

must’ve happened here! (He decides it’s not that

important; sits down on Rosita, and the back falls off causing

him to flip over.) Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! (Runs over to Stevie.)

Stevie, I was never here! (Runs out.)",65
Ross," (To Monica) Let’s grab our stuff and get the

hell out of here.",13
Monica," Oh, that’s okay, I can’t wait to see

everything again! All of the memories…",14
Ross," Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play

uncooked batter eater.",14
Monica," Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to

wait for a light bulb to cook brownies! (She goes to the

attic.)",22
Ross," Wow! Great! (Finds a pack of cigarettes.) Wait,

dad who-who’s cigarettes are these?",13
Ross," Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out

dad, (reading his grades) Math, A. Science, A. History, A.

Gym…(He puts it away and finds something else.) Oooh, my rock

polisher!",31
Ross," Oh no. Dad! Dad! What…(He goes to open one

of her boxes and it rips apart.) Oh God…everything’s

ruined! Dad, she’s gonna be crushed!",24
Phoebe," (on phone) Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office

Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? (Listens)

Earl, thanks. (Listens) Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire

Office Supplies I’d like to talk to you about your toner

needs. (She’s reading from the script.)",45
Phoebe," I’m hearing what you’re saying, but

at our prices everyone needs toner.",12
Phoebe," (doesn’t have any luck) Umm, is-is that

because you’re out of toner?",12
Phoebe," No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang

up! Just please talk to me.",14
Chandler," Good chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name

is Rosita! (He runs out the door, grabs the back of Rosita, and

we can hear Joey and Rachel talking as they are coming up the

stairs. Neither of them have reached the landing yet.)",43
Joey," Because, I know what I like and what I don’t

like! It’s not the same thing!",16
Rachel," Joey you didn't even sit in it. I'm telling you

it's such a nice chair.",15
Rachel," Come on Joey, I

just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store!

Hey, y’know what I was thinking? We could name her

Francette.",28
Rachel," Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour.

Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y’know,

start the heeling process?",24
Joey," Well, I guess you’re right. Maybe, maybe I’ll take her down to the

incinerator. It’s gonna be so said, and kinda cool. (He

goes to remove the back, but it doesn’t come off. So he sits

down in it, puts his feet up, stands up, and looks back at it.)

She’s healed!",52
Rachel," It’s not a miracle Joey! I’m sure

there’s some explanation.",10
Joey," Oh there is! If you want something enough and

your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!",17
Rachel," No, y’know what?

Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!",13
Rachel," That’s right Joey,

the chair angel came in and heeled your chair. (She sits down in

the chair.)",18
Joey," (angrily) Get your

non-believer ass outta my chair! (She gets up and heads for her

room.)",16
Ross," Dad that won’t matter to her. Look, all my

stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff!

See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you

guys love me more than you love her.",43
Ross," Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here

for some memories and damnit, we’re gonna give her some!

Okay, grab…grab some empty boxes. Okay?

We’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can

pass off as hers we’ll-we’ll put ‘em in their. ",43
Ross," Like uh y’know like this! This! (He picks up

one of those art projects that kids make in kindergarten and

first grade.) She-she could’ve made this!",26
Ross," Right? And this! (He picks

up a trophy) She-she could’ve won this!",12
Ross," You know if you wanna say

the Medical Marvel story while we work that'll be fine.",16
Rachel," (grabbing a beer out of the chair’s

fridge) I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!",18
Joey," Yeah, me too. (He flips up his armrest in

disgust.)",10
Rachel," Yeah? Wow!

Y’know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!",11
Rachel," Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and

you get radio!",13
Phoebe," Earl, you’re not

hearing me! All I’m saying is that you’re not alone all

right? Everybody hates the people they work with! (One of her

coworkers overhears that, and she mimes that she didn’t mean

him.)",36
Phoebe," Wait, what was that? That

sounded like someone being nice to you.",12
Phoebe," All right so Earl, let’s just forget about

the people at the office, okay? There-there’s gotta be

someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What

about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your

girlfriend?",37
Phoebe," No! I’m not finished yet! Don’t!

Don’t you dare hang up on me!!!",13
Monica," Hey, I just whipped us up

some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three

days.",18
Ross," (overacting as well) Yeah!

Yeah! (Laughs.) Oh, this will make a great memory.",13
Ross," Well, these. These are yours right here.

(Pointing to the boxes they just created for her.)",16
Monica," Okay. (Starting to go through them) Oh! A

coloring book! (Holding it up.)",13
Ross," Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always

had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that

coloring book.",21
Monica," (looking through it) Really? Wow! It looks like

I had some trouble staying inside the lines.",16
Monica," (holding up a small cowboy hat) This isn’t

mine. (Sets it down and looks at the rest of the boxes.) Hey,

this isn’t, this isn’t my stuff! Ugh, Ross! (Grabs and

holds up a doll.) These are your boxes! Where are my

boxes?",43
Monica," So why-why wasn’t Ross’s stuff

ruined? (Pause) And if you say the words

medical marvel I’m going to Easy Bake your head!",22
Monica," So wait, Ross’s stuff is fine, but I have

no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of

your car away from water!!!",26
Rachel," How would you like to sit in a chair that fully

reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?",22
Chandler," Yeah, I’d love to but I’ve tried

that so many times they won’t even let me in the store

anymore.",20
Rachel," Well what if I told you, you can do it in my

apartment?",13
Chandler," (excitedly) Are you telling me that you

bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems

obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the

Year?",29
Rachel," I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.

(Which is an actual product by the way, I’m not sure about

the 3000 part.)",22
Rachel," Well, it’s a long story, but umm I broke

Joey’s chair…",11
Chandler," I thought I broke Joey’s chair!

That’s why I replaced it with mine!",13
Chandler," Well, what did you think, that-that elves

came in and fixed it?",12
Chandler," I’m gettin’ my chair back! (Heads

for Joey and Rachel’s.)",10
Joey," Well, it looks like it wasn’t healed after

all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now! (Sits down in it

and groans.)",24
Rachel," Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he

switched the chairs!",12
Joey," (sarcastic) Oh no this is devastating! My faith

is shaken. I’m so glad I have the new chair to get my

through this difficult time in my life.",28
Rachel," Uh-huh! Nice

try, but you don’t get that chair anymore! All right? That

is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! (Joey starts to get up.)

No I take that back!",33
Chandler," Because you

(Points to Joey) broke a chair and you (Points to Rachel) broke a

chair! The only one around here that hasn’t broke a chair,

is me!",28
Rachel," The logic is,

that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a

chair in half!",21
Phoebe," (to Marge) Excuse me! Can you tell me where I

can find Earl? He’s the supply manager around here.",19
Phoebe," Because it was fate that made me call you

today!",10
Phoebe," No! Think about it okay? This isn’t

even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job,

you’re my first call! And-and somebody else might’ve

hung up on you, but I wouldn’t do that because I know about

this stuff. My mom killed herself.",46
Phoebe," I’m not gonna give you tips! Look

don’t you see that this-this…this all came together so

that I could stop you from doing this.",24
Phoebe," Oh. Well umm, okay here’s a weird thing.

My mother was also a supply manager.",15
Phoebe," Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay?

Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.",20
Phoebe," Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I’ve

got-I’ve got goose bumps. (She holds out her arm.)",17
Phoebe," But if—no look, okay. These jerks might

not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!",20
Phoebe," Y’know, I

don’t-I don’t think it’s you. This is a freaky

place. (To All) Hey! Guys! (Everyone looks up.) (To Earl) Oh no,

it’s you.",25
Monica," Oh, this terrible! Everything is

destroyed! Look at this. (She picks up some kind of furry thing.)

It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don’t

even know what it is! Ohh, it’s still soft. (She rubs it

against her cheek.) What do you think this is?",50
Monica," How do you think I am?! You’ve wrecked all

my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just

rubbed a dead mouse on my face!",28
Monica," Wait, you’re giving me your Porsche,

you’re kidding me right?!",10
Ross," Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I

mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!",21
Monica," Do you guys know what happened to

Chandler’s barca lounger?",10
Rachel," Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.",11
Monica," Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and

the barca lounger’s gone?! This is the best day ever! (Runs

out.)",20
Chandler," (To Monica) She’s not as pretty as she

was when she was 29.",13
Monica," They all came from the list you handed out to

us two weeks ago.",14
Rachel," Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?",10
Joey," Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that

big a deal.",12
Ross," Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned

thirty?",11
Joey," (screaming) Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let

the others grow old! Not me!! (He buries his head in

Phoebe’s lap for comfort.)",24
Ross," Hey, 30 is not that old! Do

you know how old the Earth is?",14
Rachel," Late thirties? Oh

come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?",16
Chandler," No Rach, it’s not just you. My thirtieth

birthday certainly wasn’t that much fun.",14
Joey," (screaming) And now Chandler! We’re all

gettin’ so old! (Looking up) Why are you doing this to us?!

(Turns away crying.)",21
Monica," Rach, you’re in a great place in your

life. Come on, you’ve got a great job! Good friends…",18
Joey," I promised myself

I wasn't going to cry at this one.",11
Rachel," Look, y’know I know my life’s going

pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people

who’ve accomplished so many other goals by the time

they’re thirty.",31
Phoebe," I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop!

That’s it!! That’s everything I wanted to do before I

was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my

sister. But oh well. Yay!! (They all cheer again.) And-and girls

this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean. (Rachel and

Monica look intrigued and as they all head into Central Perk,

Rachel picks up the hippity-hop that Phoebe left behind.)",74
Rachel," Thirty. Ugh, I mean

thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the

fifth grade? She was thirty!",20
Monica," Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better

than doing something stupid, like Ross.",14
Ross," Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that

car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!",17
Chandler," Ross, a sports car? Wouldn’t it have

been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?",16
Ross," That’s not what this is about okay? I-I am a

sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.",19
Rachel," Really! God

Ross, what were you thinking? (To Phoebe, quietly) I know

it’s really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.",23
Phoebe," Oh, well get in line

missy. (To Ross) So, can I have a ride stud?",15
Ross," Hop in. (Phoebe hops in.) Get ready for the

smoothest ride of your life. ",14
Rachel," Y’know what? I am going to do something

today. I’m not just gonna sit around like some old lady.

I’m gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or

my tongue or something.",35
Rachel," So what?! Y’know what? The way I see

it—(Phoebe pinches the back of her head)—Ow! Son of a

bitch!!",19
Rachel," (glares at him) Get out, get out of my

apartment. ",10
Monica," All right Rach, for what it’s worth, I

think that you’re doing great. I mean y’know let’s

face it, no one handles this well.",24
Chandler," (To Joey) Would you put that back on?!

Monica’s gonna be here any minute!",14
Chandler," (frustrated) Okay, for the last time.

It’s not named for each individual man.",13
Chandler," Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I

can’t believe that you would have a thirty-year-old

daughter! (To Mr. Geller) And you! I can’t believe that you

would have a tux that’s thirty years old! (Puts his hand on

Mr. Geller’s shoulder.)",44
Chandler," Ohh! (He quickly removes his hand and looks

at it.)",10
Rachel," (entering) Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw

her! She’s coming!",10
Chandler," Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!

(Rachel turns off the lights and everyone crouches. As everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from

the assemblage.)",24
Chandler," (getting up to investigate) Okay, everybody

stay here. I will find out what’s going on.",15
Monica," Nooo! (Giggles) Okay. (She tries to pull

herself up by Rachel and Joey’s doorknob, but the door opens

and she almost falls into the their apartment. She manages to

catch herself.) Whoa! (Stands up, unsteadily) Okay. See I was, I

was a little nervous about turning (whispering) thirty.

(Giggles.) So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. (Pause) I

wanna puke on you later!",66
Chandler," Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very

formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are

in there and your parents!",27
Monica," Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk!

(Pause) That they know of.",14
Chandler," Okay, here’s the thing. We’re gonna

get you some coffee and they will never know that you’re

drunk.",18
Chandler," (laughing) Okay we have to do something about

your breath.",10
Chandler," That’s still yours. Okay, now remember

it’s a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.",17
Ross," Okay, forward. Forward—Stop! (The car moves

an inch and Ross runs to the back of the car.) Okay,

back—Stop! (The car barely moves and Ross runs back to the

front.) Okay, forward—Stop! Stop! Stop!",34
Monica," Ross, just

forget about it. This guy’s got you totally wedged in.",12
Phoebe," (running up) Okay. Okay, here’s what

we’re gonna do. Okay, I’m gonna break into this

mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross

can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. (She

opens her coat and reveals that thing car thieves use to break

into cars as Ross jumps in behind the wheel. She inserts the

device, unlocks the door, opens it, and the alarm goes off.) Haul

ass!!!! (Runs off.)",80
Phoebe," Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! (Hands her the

hippity-hop.) It’s for the child in you, and the woman.

Happy thirtieth!",19
Phoebe," (reading the certificate) Oh my God! Oh my God,

we are 31.",12
Phoebe," Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what

it is?",11
Chandler," Okay before we start

the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.",15
Chandler," See? (Does his laugh.)

Here we go. (Starts walking her to their room, and has to pass in

front of Mr. Geller who’s sitting at the table and Mrs.

Geller who’s standing next to him.)",35
Chandler," Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed.

(Monica stumbles on the steps.) Okay, (catches her) you’re

doing great. Okay look at that-look

at that we made it all the way across the room. You’re doing great. You’re doing fine.",42
Phoebe," Oh! She is so

much more fun than regular Monica.",10
Chandler," (To Monica) Go change!

(To Phoebe) She doesn’t want her parents to know she’s

drunk.",15
Phoebe," Ohh! All right! All right. Here’s what

we’ll do, I’ll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no

one’s will even notice her.",24
Chandler," (To Rachel) Okay, will you just go help her

change please!",11
Rachel," Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman

seems like a job for Joey.",15
Ross," (to Tag) Stick to the list. Always stick to the

list.",11
Joey," Now that you’re a couple, we don’t get

two presents from you guys?",13
Chandler," For my last birthday you gave me a hug!

(To Rachel) Okay, read the card! Read the card!",18
Rachel," Okay. (Opens the card and reads it.) Happy

birthday Grandma! It’s better to be over the hill (starting

to cry) then buried under it. (Breaks down as everyone glares at

them.) All our love Monica and Chandler. (Crying) That’s

funny, yeah!",41
Rachel," No I know, because to be a grandmother you have

to be married and have children and I don’t have any of

those things. That’s why it’s so funny. I'm just going to go...(Runs into her room

crying.)",38
Ross," Hey! Look who’s back!

It’s the birthday girl! How’s the birthday girl

feeling?",13
Rachel," Well, I feel fine, but I

think you’re bumming out the rest of the kids.",15
Ross," What? (Glances over and

sees the faces of the rest of the group, then goes and sits

down.)",18
Rachel," Okay! Y’know what? I realized it was

stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I

really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids…",31
Phoebe," Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at

the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.",22
Rachel," As I was saying… I should probably have

the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives

me five years.",24
Rachel," So, if I wanna have my kid when I’m 35, I

don’t have to get pregnant until I’m 34. Which gives Prada

four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do

want to be married for a year before I get pregnant…",45
Monica," Really! That long?! (Chandler slowly turns and

looks at her.) (To Chandler) Look all you want, it’s

happening!",18
Rachel," No, so I don’t have to get married until

I’m 33! That’s three years, that’s three whole

years—Oh, wait a minute though. I’ll need a year and a

half to plan the wedding, and I’d like to know the guy for a

year, year and a half before we get engaged… Which means I

need to meet the guy by the time I’m thirty.",64
Ross," Which is fine! Because you just

turned—(Removes two candles from the

cake)—twenty-eight!",12
Rachel," No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according

to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!",21
Rachel," (To Chandler) I’m telling you it’s

like watching Bambi learn how to walk.",13
Ross," (To Monica) You’re drunk! Mom and dad are

gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I’m a little drunk.",16
Chandler," (to a waiter) Oh

that’s great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here

please? (The waiter comes over) There we go.",24
Joey," (to the waiter) Hey! Are those crab cakes? (The

waiter nods) Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more

crab cakes were ready?",27
Monica," You are so handsome! I wanna make love

to you right here, right now! (Growls and pulls him into a kiss.)",21
Ross, I really wish that you wouldn’t. (Laughs and leans to a girl on the couch.),15
Chandler," (To Monica) Now all you have to do is just

get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed,

okay? Just smile and don’t talk to anyone.",32
Phoebe," (clinking two glasses together) Speech! Speech!

Let’s hear from the birthday girl! Huh?",13
Phoebe," Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at

me! The plan’s working! I didn’t even have to take off

my top yet!",20
Monica," I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family

and my friends…",12
Monica," I really like to say that I’m-um…

(Pause) Y’know what I’d really like to say? I’m

drunk!! (Mrs. Geller pulls the camera down.) That’s right

mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! (Ross grabs the

camera out of his dad’s hands.) And guess what! I’ve

been drunk before! And I’ve smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my

underwear drawer! But you know what,

you know what? It’s all okay. It’s okay because

I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because

I am a grown up. (Falls over sideways with Ross filming

the fall.)",105
Phoebe," (To Joey) Okay quick, help me get this off!

(Motions to her top.)",13
Phoebe," I lost a whole year! I can’t believe it!

This is so unfair!",13
Phoebe," Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel

if you found out you were 31?",17
Joey," That’s not gonna happen. No. (Looks up)

Because we have a new deal!",13
Phoebe," Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I…I

haven’t done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I

was 31!",23
Phoebe," Like okay I-I-I, I haven’t met any

Portuguese people! I, I haven’t had the perfect kiss! And I

haven’t been to sniper’s school!",23
Monica," Phoebe, y’know why don’t we just go

upstairs and have some birthday cake?",13
Phoebe," No, I just feel like being by myself for a

while. All right? I’ll see you guys later. Thanks. (Gets up

and exits.)",23
Joey," Hey, y’know what you guys? I think I’m

gonna go walk her home. (Gets up and runs out.) ",18
Joey," Pheebs! Wait up! (She stops.) Listen uh, close

your eyes. (She does so and Joey passionately kisses her.) Maybe

that’s one thing you can cross off your list.",28
Ross," Okay, is everybody clear? We’re gonna pick

it up…and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay?

We’re gonna lift the car…and slide it out. Lift

and slide!",29
Monica," All right,

c'mon dogs! Let's lift this sucker! Oh, unless you're scared,

little weaklings...scared.",14
Ross," All right everyone, lift! (They and try to lift

the car, of course it doesn’t raise up) And slide!!

(Everyone leans over, but the car still does not move.)",29
Rachel," Ohh Tag, umm…you’re such a great guy

and we have sooo much fun together but I don’t-I

don’t…",18
Rachel," Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I

was referring to uhh, but I just think I’m past the point

where I think I can y’know, just have fun.",32
Rachel," Yeah, it is! But you’re just a kid! I mean

you’re 25!",12
Rachel," Oh God! Y’know what I wish? I wish you

were six years older. Well actually, if I’m wishin’ for

stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.",28
Rachel," Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for

another year?",14
Joey," (entering, limping, and holding his arm) I

don’t like this anymore. (He sits down with them in pain.)",18
Chandler," Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty

year olds.",11
Ross," God, do you realize in ten years we’re gonna

be 40?",11
Joey," (crying) Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!

(He buries his head in Ross’s shoulder.)",17
Joey," All-all right! (They run and jump in the car.)

Start it up! Let’s go!",14
Ross," Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey’s

special romance magazines in there?",14
Ross," Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The

dean’s office just called and said there was an urgent

meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?",29
Rachel," Well that—y’know it’s just uh,

I’ve never done that before. Me and him alone.",14
Rachel," Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do

with him?",13
Ross," I don’t know! Just-just talk to

him-entertain him and keep him alive.",12
Ross," Okay. (Ben enters) Ben? Come here. All right,

I’m gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour.

Okay? Are you gonna be okay?",26
Ross," Okay, I’ll

see you soon buddy. (He hugs and kisses him.) Be back in an hour.",16
Rachel," Bye. (Ross

exits.) Ahhh… (Silence) So this is fun, huh?",10
Rachel," Okay. Well

that’s pretty much all that we have—Oh! Oh! Have you

ever had a virgin margarita? (Holds up a bottle of margarita

mix.)",24
Monica," What about the second minister we meet with? I

kinda liked him.",12
Chandler," Easy for you to say; you’ll be wearing a

veil.",10
Chandler," You mean the guy who kept staring at your

chest?",10
Chandler," Sorry, I just don’t like the idea of

when I say, ""I do,"" he’s thinking, ""Yeah,

I’d do her too!""",20
Monica," Well, we’re trying to find someone to

perform our wedding and they’re all either boring or

annoying or y’know, can’t stop staring at the ladies.

(Points to her chest.)",29
Phoebe," No! No! It’s-it’s uh a real thing!

Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings

and stuff!",20
Phoebe," Yes! A friend of mine did

it and it’s totally legal!",11
Chandler," Guys thank you very much but neither of you

is marrying us.",12
Chandler," We are going to have a legitimate member of

the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control

of his saliva!",25
Joey," I CALL THEM!!!

(Takes the muffins from Gunther's hands. Everyone looks at Joey

in disbelief.)",15
Rachel," Ben y’know when uh, when you were a baby,

you and I used to hang out all the time. ‘Cause I was, I was

your daddy’s girlfriend.",27
Rachel," Hey! We were not on a—Okay. That’s fine! Fine.

Y’know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going

to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas,

okay?",36
Rachel," (checks her watch) Fifty-two minutes. (Pause)

So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That

must be nice. You don’t have to share stuff.",22
Rachel," Oh, you’re one of those.

But y’know what? I have two sisters of my own and we

just-just tortured each other.",21
Rachel," Well y’know, we would umm, repeat

everything the other said, or uh, we’d jump out of closets

to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so

they’d put salt on their cereal.",35
Rachel," I’m funny? Oh thank God! Well hey,

I’ve got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear—Do you want a

good one? Here’s a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a

quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right?

(Does so.) And then you say to person, I bet you can’t roll

this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving

your face. And then when they do it, they’re left with a big

black pencil line right down the center of their face.",89
Joey," So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys

yet?",11
Chandler," No, but Horny for Monica Minister called,

wanting to know if we were still together.",15
Joey," No-no-no! Look, I’ve been thinking about it.

I’m an actor right? So I won’t get nervous talking in

front of people.",21
Joey," No-no-no-no look no! I won’t spit, and I

won’t stare at Monica’s breasts! Y’know? Everyone

knows I’m an ass man!",20
Joey," Yeah and the most important thing is that it

won’t be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you.

It’ll be me! And I swear I’ll do a really good job.

Plus, y’know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a

lot to me.",47
Joey," All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta

get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers

can still have sex right?",24
Monica," Here, take a couple of

these. (She gets up to grab a couple of pills.)",15
Phoebe," Oh no, I don’t

believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to

these points right here. (She’s pinching the bit of skin

between her right thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) Then

your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so

thanks. (Takes the pills.)",52
Monica," Okay, while we’re

waiting for these pills to kick in, I’m gonna sit you down

on the couch. Come on. (Phoebe gets up and goes with her.) Get

some nice soft pillows under your head, I’m gonna turn the

TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I’m—Sit

down—(She sits down on the couch)—gonna make you some

tea. And then, I’m gonna rub your feet.",67
Joey," Oh! My head! Oh! (He’s

sitting on the chair, lies back, and puts his feet up for Monica

to rub.) Oh!",21
Rachel," Oh yeah? Did he pull the old… (She is

waving her hand up and down her face. She’s thinking about

the pencil mark.)",23
Ross," That’s right! That’s right! Saran

Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!",15
Ross," Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes!

They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t

want my son learning them!",21
Rachel," Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet

seat, you don’t think that’s just a little funny?!",17
Ross," I was barefoot. (Rachel

laughs.) You see this is exactly what I'm talking about. You're

not laughing with someone, you're laughing at someone, and

laughing at someone is not nice!",30
Ross," Now tell me, the toilet thing is the

only thing you taught him right?",14
Phoebe," It’s amazing! My

headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?",12
Phoebe," Oh, I love you Hexadrin!

(She kisses the box.) Oh look! It comes with a story! (She pulls

out the instructions and side affects paper.)",25
Monica," No Phoebe, those are like

the side affects and stuff.",10
Phoebe," Oh my God! (Starts

reading them.) Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial

swelling, nausea, headache—Headache. Vomiting, stomach

bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don’t recall any of this

coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh

I’m sorry, extra strength death capsules!",43
Monica," Phoebe, relax none of

that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal

reasons!",17
Joey," Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! (Holds up

the piece of paper bearing the proof of his ordination.)",18
Joey," Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is

a lot of porn out there!",16
Joey," Okay now I can

officially marry anyone I want. (Looks around. A nice couple

walks by.) Hey, you two seem really happy. If you wanna get

married, give me a call! (to the girl) If not, you

give me a call.",41
Phoebe," I have liver damage. Ow!

Oh! (She grabs the left side of her torso.)",14
Monica," Phoebe, your liver is

right here. (She points to the right side of her torso.)",15
Joey," Anyway, I started working on what I’m going

to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?",18
Joey," Now-now, listen this is just a first draft

so… (Starts to read the piece of paper he brought.) ""We

are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the

special love that Monica and Chandler share."" (Monica and

Chandler like it so far.) Eh? (He continues reading.) ""It is

a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and

sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and

received. And through this having and giving and sharing and

receiving."" (Phoebe nods her

approval.) ""We too can share and love and have and

receive.""",99
Rachel," Well y’know I was just in the neighborhood

and I passed by your building and I thought to myself,

""What’s up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?""",27
Rachel," I’d love that. I would loooove…

(Carol goes to make the coffee and she sits down.) So uh, so

where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...",31
Rachel," I found him! (To Ben) Very funny, come here!

(She sits down on the coffee table and Ben walks up.) That is

exactly why I’ve come here to talk to you okay?",32
Rachel," Yes oh—(To Ben)—Do I want sugar in my

coffee? (Ben nods no.) No, just some milk would be good Carol.

Thanks. (To Ben) Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught

you yesterday?",34
Phoebe," I feel like my face is

swelling. (To Monica) Is my face swelling?",13
Monica," Phoebe, your face is

fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop

being such a baby!",22
Phoebe," Oh, interesting you

should call me that! Now that I may never have one! (Holds up the

warning label.)",19
Joey," Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are

you ready?",12
Joey," (reading) ""When I think of the love that

these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the

lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and…""

And then I can’t think of a good word for right here. (He

points to the stop on the paper where he left off.)",54
Chandler," See Joe, not that that’s not grrreat!

But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform

the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y’know, it can be

more personal. You can tell stories about us!",40
Joey," Ooh, like the time you and

I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up

your whole steak?! Remember?",25
Chandler," No, not us…

(Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)",12
Monica," I gotcha. Sorry. (To

Monica) So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?",16
Phoebe," Did you ever feed him a

poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?",15
Chandler," See Joe, we want you to

tell stories but y’know, romantic stories. Nice stories.",14
Joey," Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I’ll talk

about London! Y’know when you two hooked up! Only, only I

won’t say hooked up. I’ll say, ""Began their

beautiful journey…""",29
Joey," Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it

happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next

thing y’know you’re in the bathtub together and

she’s feeding you strawberries?",34
Chandler," Isn’t that what happened with you and

the bride’s maid?",10
Monica," Well, I was umm, I was really sad

that night because this guy that I was Ross’s mom.",18
Monica," And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he

consoled me. And well we drank too much…",17
Chandler," And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked

her to her hotel room and said goodnight.",17
Monica," (standing outside) Cute PJ’s! You’re

really livin’ it up here in London huh?",13
Chandler," Well, last time I saw him he was heading out

the door with the bride’s maid and a bucket of strawberries.

So uh, you’re not still upset about what that guy told ya

are ya?",35
Chandler," Well, look it’s been a really emotional

time y’know, and you’ve had a lot to drink. And

you’ve just got to let that go okay? I mean you were

the most beautiful in the room tonight!",36
Chandler," You kidding? You’re the most beautiful

woman in most rooms… (She jumps up and kisses him.)

(Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s going on? You

and I just made out! You and I are making out?",37
Monica," Drunk enough to know that I want to do this.

Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.",21
Chandler," Well, I have kissed over four women. (They

kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?",17
Chandler," Well I think it’s safe to say that our

friendship is effectively ruined.",13
Chandler," Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!

(Monica hides under the covers as Joey enters. Remember?)",13
Chandler," Hey Joe! I was just watching a

movie-e-e… (Notices that the TV is turned off.)",15
Joey," Hey no-no-no-no! It’s cool! It’s cool!

I-I’ll only be a second, I’m still with my bride’s

maid, I just—Where are those condoms you brought?",24
Joey," Ah. (Joey walks to Chandler’s bag by getting

as far away from Chandler’s bed as possible.)",16
Joey," Hey listen, why don’t

you come downstairs with me? There’s some really nice girls

down there.",16
Joey," All right, here you go buddy. (He tosses him

one.) Go nuts. (Exits.)",13
Joey," That’s what that was?!

‘Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something,

but it did nothing for me.",21
Monica," Okay, can we change the

topic? Because it’s really doing nothing for me.",13
Joey," Oh… (To Chandler) Can you imagine if I

hadn’t left you that last one? You two might’ve never

gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker

up to the room like I was gonna?! It’s like it was in the

stars!",44
Phoebe," Yeah, it’s totally meant to be. (To

Monica) Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that

night.",20
Monica," Okay, fine but please don’t be

upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I

just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just

wanted…just sex. So, when I…went to your room that

night…I was actually looking…for Joey. (Joey smiles.)",41
Chandler," (To Monica) Oh my God! So you came to the room looking for Joey?

Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?",23
Chandler," Oh, it’s not important? It’s not

important?! If it wasn’t for a bride’s maid you’d

be marrying him (Points to Joey) not me!",23
Monica," Noo!! The point is that

is was you that was there that night! It is you

that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!",29
Joey," And it is a love that is

based on having and giving and receiv—(Shuts up on

Monica’s glare.)",18
Chandler," I don’t believe

it. The most romantic night of my life and I’m runner up.",15
Monica," Chandler, please! Do you know how

unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!",17
Joey," Hey! (Monica turns and looks at him) Now I’m

a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!",19
Chandler," (To Joey) Look there is no way you’re

doing this wedding now. Okay?",13
Joey," What?! That’s not fair! It’s not my

fault! I was off with my bride’s maid! And who’s to say

I would’ve even said yes?! (To Monica) I mean I

would’ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to

big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out

okay!",52
Chandler," Okay, it’s just weird! Okay? I

don’t want to be standing their saying my vows and then

having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need…I

don’t know what I need. I need a walk.",36
Chandler," It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman,

and instead you had to settle for Robin. (Walks out and

slams the door.)",24
Monica," Phoebe, what

were you thinking, how you could tell him that?",11
Phoebe," I'm sorry, I

wasn't thinking. It just came out........(thinks) It's a side

effect!",13
Ross," Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my

face?",12
Ross,"

Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student

in my last class of the day to say uh, (In a college frat boy

voice) ""Dude, don’t you ever was your face?""",31
Rachel," All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I

didn’t tell you but you were so mad

already!",16
Ross," Of course I was mad! I told

you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it’s not funny!",16
Rachel," Or Carol! But

they’re funny to kids and who is it hurting?!",12
Ross," Uh, y’know what?

I’ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his

clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the

principal’s office wearing nothing but a catcher’s

mitt!",37
Rachel," That was you?! We heard

about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in

the air and shout, ""I will be revenged?!""",26
Ross,"
I will be! Listen, I don’t want you

teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?",15
Rachel," Fine. Fine, but

I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he

called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go back to being Boring and

Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want!",43
Ross," No that’s not what I

want. Uh, I’m glad you guys were bonding but I…",15
Rachel," Look he doesn’t have any brothers or

sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff! And

I haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old

doesn’t know anyway!",29
Chandler," Hey. Do you want this scone? (Holds up his

plate) It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with

you!",22
Chandler," Look Joe, I know you

wanted to do the wedding…",10
Joey," No-hey-no! If you don’t want me to do it, I

except that. I don’t care about that. I just…I

don’t want you to be upset.",25
Chandler," How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally

fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she

wanted you first!",25
Joey," Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler,

she wants you for the rest of her life! You’re

so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although

you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did,

‘cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y’know,

we look at you and-and we see you together and it just…it-it

fits. Y’know? And you just know it’s gonna last

forever.",76
Joey," Well I don’t know remember exactly but,

it’s-it’s pretty much about having and giving and

sharing and receiving.",18
Ross," Hey I’m sorry to do this to you again but

uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit?

I-I’ve got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for

his uh, ‘Fun Aunt’ Rachel, so…",40
Rachel," Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have

fun, don’t we Ben? (He nods yes.)",17
Rachel," Ohh, okay. (Ross has a sign on his back that

reads ‘Poop.’) Wh—Ah-ha! (Ross stops and turns.)

Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can’t do it.",26
Rachel," I can’t let him go

out that way, he’s got a meeting. (To Ross)

You’ve got something here on your back.",21
Ross," What? (She takes the sign off and hands it to

him.) That’s great. That is great. (Crumples up the paper

and throws it down in anger.) What did we just finish talking

about Ben?!",34
Ross," All right, that’s it! (He runs over to Ben,

but he runs past him and out the door.) Come—you—no!

You are in big trouble young man!",26
Ross," I-I-am—(Suddenly Ross starts screaming and

comes falling down the stairs landing just in front of Rachel.)",16
Rachel," EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!! (She runs over to him and

finds that it was a dummy and that she had been had.)",24
Chandler," Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I

over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more

important.",23
Phoebe," I’m really glad you guys are okay but, I

just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two (Points to

Monica and Joey) actually had hooked up.",27
Joey," Ho-ho-ho, (pausing for a rest next to the fridge)

fried stuff with cheese!",13
Phoebe," (still

reading the label) Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! (Checks

her watch) That’s it! I’m out of the woods! Ohh! What a

relief!",26
Phoebe," Oh,

it’s like huge weight has been lifted! ‘Cause look,

(reads the side affects) no hair loss, not a rash, no hives,

I’m just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no

temporary euphoria—Oh.",34
Monica," Do you realize that four weeks from today we’re getting married?

Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!",16
Monica, There’s still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?,12
Chandler," I figured I’d buy those. Pat, I’d like to buy a vow.

(Laughs)",13
Monica," Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.",15
Monica, No! But I know exactly what I’m going to say.,10
Chandler, Do you happen to know what I’m going to say?,10
Monica," (handing him a pad of paper and a pen) Let’s just do it right now.

Okay? It won’t be hard. Just say what’s in your heart. (She goes back, sits

down, and starts feverishly writing.)",35
Chandler," (watching in her) (in his head) Look at her go! She must love me

more than I love her! What’s wrong with me? Ooh, don’t open that door.",28
Chandler," (writing) Monica, there are no words… (To Joey and Ross) There

are no words! This should not be this hard!",20
Joey," All right, uh… (To Ross) Oh hey, you’ve done this before Ross,

well what did you say when you made up your vows?",23
Ross," Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I

die. She made no such promise.",20
Chandler," I’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You

should’ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!",17
Monica," You have to help me! I’m supposed to be writing my vows and all I

have is this! (Shows them what she’s been working on.)",25
Rachel," Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.",13
Ross," Well, why don’t you just start with something simple. Like umm,

Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.",23
Rachel," Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, ""Chandler, even

though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more.""",27
Chandler," All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on

Earth. Would you go out with me?",18
Phoebe," Well maybe you don’t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you

just say something about, y’know, all the things that he’s taught you.

Like… (They all try to think about one example and don’t succeed.) Or all the

things you taught him.",43
Monica," Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling

them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out there’s more than

three), five, six, and seven!",31
Chandler," Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down.",10
Rachel," Well, y’know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that

could’ve meant.)",11
Monica," All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3,

5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7,

6-7, 7 …7..…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…(mouths 7)! (They both lean back

on the couch satisfied.)",48
Joey," Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, ""Monica…",10
Chandler, (writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?,12
Joey," Well, I can’t do everything! Look back over your time together.",11
Monica, No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?,12
Chandler," All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are

married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?",28
Monica," Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?",10
Monica, What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriageable about me?,10
Chandler," Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back

of the chair he was sitting in)",19
Monica," Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)",11
Monica," Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)",12
Monica, I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.),12
Chandler," Nothing! I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I

just stopped talking!",16
Chandler, No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!,11
Chandler,"  Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?",10
Monica," Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it

doesn’t make any sense.",17
Chandler," Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m

saying?",12
Monica," Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky.

(Starting to cry.) As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a

reason why girls don’t do this!",32
Chandler," Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God,

I thought… (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I

thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing

that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.

(Starting to cry again.) And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life

trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you

marry me?",101
Joey, (yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!,13
Monica," Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.)

We’re engaged!!!",14
Ross," Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because

Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.",19
Phoebe," Well let’s just say its.. she’s lucky she has a sweet ass,

‘cause she’s not so good at the writing.",20
Ross, I can’t believe that in four weeks they’re gonnta be married!,11
Phoebe," Well let’s just hope it works. Y’know, nine out of ten

marriages end in divorce?",15
Ross," Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.",15
Chandler," Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about

chicken.",15
Chandler," Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some coleslaw, some beans, and a Coke—(Yelps

in pain as Monica grabs him underwater)—Diet Coke.",21
Joey, I know! I mean it’s not like we weren’t cool about it.,12
Chandler," The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a

big deal out of it.",19
Joey, But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! ,11
Monica," Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?

Just promise you won't tell.",17
Monica," (on phone) I can't wait to be with you!  I'll just tell Rachel I'm

gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.",23
Chandler," (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is

absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)",20
Monica," (on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…",10
Rachel," Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around

wondering what to do.)",16
Phoebe," (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts

yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes

off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!",29
Rachel," Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know, so you have to stop

screaming!!",16
Rachel," (trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down)

HI!! Hi! ",15
Rachel," Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this

apartment!",14
Ross," Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe

starts jumping to divert his attention.)",18
Phoebe," (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and

Rachel.)",11
Phoebe," Okay, so now they know that you know, and they don't know that Rachel

knows?",15
Joey," Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us

know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would

finally be over!",35
Phoebe," Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our

own",16
Rachel," All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.",12
Phoebe," Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She

pinches his butt.)",16
Chandler," (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate

and the pinching!!",14
Chandler," Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?",11
Monica," Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!",11
Joey, And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!,14
Monica," Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But, see,

they don't know that we know that they know! So…",23
Phoebe," I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God!

He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!",28
Rachel," I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenly

and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we

know?",32
Rachel," Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!",10
Phoebe," God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with

us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey,

you can't say anything!",34
Chandler," Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put

lotion on her! ",17
Chandler," Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little

mimic of her dance.)",17
Joey, (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!,10
Rachel," Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler

the sooner this is all over and out in the open.",24
Joey," I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras!

Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)",30
Phoebe," Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons.",11
Monica," You go back out there, and you seduce her till she cracks!",12
Chandler," Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?",12
Phoebe," Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is

showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.",21
Chandler," (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very

happy we're gonna have all the sex.",18
Phoebe, You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.,12
Chandler," Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.",12
Chandler, Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!,13
Chandler," Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! (They

walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.",17
Phoebe," I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in

love!",15
Chandler," Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.",11
Ross," (He notices something through the window.) No! No! Wh… What are you

doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!",23
Phoebe," How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having

kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.

And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo

dealership.",44
Joey, I don’t want them to move to a Volvo dealership!,10
Joey," I’m sorry, I just…I like things the way they are.",10
Ross," Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?",12
Monica," Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the

gang at Java Joe's'. ",18
Rachel," Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?",13
Ross, Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile),13
Rachel," Well, we were just talkin’ about you guys gettin’ married and

how great it is.",15
Joey," Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that’s what you really want.",12
Monica," Yeah, I don’t hear Chandler’s and he doesn’t hear mine.",10
Joey, (starting to cry) I have never known love like this.,10
Joey," Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up

to twice their size and never go back.",21
Rachel," (looking at her fingers) Oh my…God! Let me see that! (Grabs the

book from him.)",15
Phoebe, I brought you my old maternity clothes! (Sets a bag on the counter.),13
Rachel," Oh Pheebs that’s so sweet—(Grabs a pair of pants)—Ooh,

those are so cute!",13
Phoebe," Yeah! And look, (Grabs the pants) see how they expand as the baby grows?

(There’s a stretchy part in front.) And then after the baby’s born, they’re

great for shoplifting melons.",31
Monica," (entering) Oh good you’re all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four

o’clock. (To Rachel) Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from

high school?",25
Monica," He was in Ross’s class…marching band…kinda overweight?

Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.",17
Rachel," Wow! I don’t remember him. Honey, are you sure you’re not

talking about your imaginary boyfriend.",16
Monica," No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven’t thought about him in a long

time… (Stares off into the distance lost in thought.) (Pause) Anyway, umm

Will’s, Will’s here on business and he didn’t have a place to go so I

invited him here.",43
Monica," Oh, and by the way, he’s lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks

goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! (Joey clears his throat.) I still

love Chandler.",30
Joey, I just want you to say it once in a while.,11
Monica," All right okay, just so you know, I’m not gonna make a turkey this

year.",15
Joey," No they’re not! They’re ugly and stupid and delicious!

Plus, eating them is like a tradition. It goes back to the 

very first Thanksgiving when the Indians sat down with the cowboys",32
Rachel," Oh right... That's when they had that 

big rodeo at Plymouth Rock.",12
Monica," All right! Okay, it’s just Phoebe. Will’s still on a diet,

Chandler doesn’t eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel’s having her aversion to

poultry.",23
Rachel," Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast

chicken?",16
Joey," Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and

made it walk across the table.",22
Monica," Anyway, it just doesn’t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for

just three people. Okay? It’s a lot of work.",22
Joey," But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no

turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!",28
Monica," All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’s

gonna be a ton left over.",18
Joey, No there won’t! I promise I will finish that turkey!,10
Monica," All right, you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just

one sitting?",15
Joey," That’s right! ‘Cause I’m a Tribbiani! (To Rachel) And this

is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don’t read a

lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!",39
Monica," Hey, isn’t weird to think about how next year at this time

they’ll be a little baby at the table? (Chandler turns around in horror.) (Seeing

him) Rachel’s! But good to know where you’re at!",35
Monica," Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he’s

really into the game so I don’t want to bother him. Could you help me fold these

napkins? (Hands her a stack of them.)",35
Monica, I’m gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.,11
Monica," No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We’re not at a barn

dance. You’ve gotta—you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at

Christmas time, remember?",30
Phoebe," Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. (Monica exits.) (To

Chandler) So how’s the game?",17
Chandler," Yeah! I’m just pretending to watch the game so I don’t have

to help out with stuff.",17
Phoebe," I don’t believe you! That is…brilliant! And Monica has no

idea?",11
Chandler, Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV. ,13
Chandler," Yeah! Anderson just scored again! (To Phoebe) There’s no

Anderson.",10
Phoebe," Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don’t think I can help

you after all, I didn’t realize this game was on.",26
Phoebe," Well normally I don’t, but y’know…(looks at the

TV)…Green Bay is playing.",12
Phoebe," Well it’s only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it’s not bad.

It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to

June. J }",31
Monica," Aww thanks! God Will I’m so glad that you came! You look great! You

must’ve lost like…",17
Monica," You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler.

Chandler, this is Will.",17
Chandler," Oh hey. I’d shake your hand but uh; I’m really into the

game. Plus, I think it’d be better for my ego if we didn’t stand right next to

each other.",31
Phoebe," (nonchalantly glancing) Hey. (Turns back around.) Wow! (Looks up.) Well

done.",11
Monica," Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.",10
Chandler," (To Phoebe) Y’know, it’s been a while since we’ve

screamed something. Maybe we should.",14
Monica," Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you’ve got almost an

entire turkey to eat.",17
Joey," Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach

first. Eatin’ chips is like stretching.",22
Ross," Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! (They hug and Ross

realizes what he said.) Hot stuff?",19
Ross," Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?",10
Ross," Oh! Man I don’t think I’ve seen you since uh, Lance Davis’

graduation party.",14
Ross," Yeah. It would’ve been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.",14
Monica, Hey sweetie. Oh good. (Takes the baking dish from her.),10
Rachel," Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, 

smouldering

thing going on. (We see Will angrily staring at Rachel.) Oh my God, he’s… Look

at the way he’s just staring at me. I think he’s trying to mouth something to

me, but I can’t make it out. (Will mouths, ""I hate you."")",56
Phoebe," Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green

Bay…Mermen.",15
Rachel," Really?! Aren’t you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am

having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at

Lance Davis’ graduation party?",34
Monica," (breaking it up) Uh Rachel? Rachel, why don’t you sit here? (Next

to Joey) And Will you sit way over there. (The other side of the table.)",27
Joey," That’s it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At

least give me a challenge!",19
Monica," (laughs) This is Chandler’s chicken. This is the turkey. (Sets down

a huge turkey.)",14
Rachel," What? (Joey starts offering Ross some turkey.) Oh y’know what? Can

we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table?

The smell is just yuck!",33
Rachel," Umm, I’m sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?",11
Monica," (To Rachel) Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high

school.",14
Monica," Okay. (Chandler grabs the dish from Monica and hands it to Will who

starts dishing out a large helping.)",19
Rachel," Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I’m real sorry for whatever

I-I did to you in high school…",21
Rachel," Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who

else was in this club?",19
Rachel, (To Ross) So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?,11
Ross," Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but

I-I don’t think he-he knew what it was.",19
Rachel," So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an

I Hate Rachel club.",21
Ross, That was in high school! It’s not like it was binding forever.,12
Joey," I'm thinking of joining an ""I Hate Turkey 

Club""... although I do love a turkey club.",16
Monica," I swear I didn’t. (To Ross and Will) Hey! Is that why you guys used

to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?",25
Ross," Look Rach I-I’m sorry, okay? I…I was a stupid kid, okay? The

only reason I joined…",16
Ross," …co-founded, Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love

with you. Obviously I didn’t handle it very well. But if you think about it the I

Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.",38
Rachel," Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say

mean things about me?",18
Phoebe," Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!",12
Ross," It was no big deal. We-we…said that the rumor was…that

umm…you had both…male and female reproductive parts.",17
Chandler," Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite

cheerleader from Long Island?!",14
Rachel," Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This

is why Adam Carter wouldn’t go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay

in this region! (Motions to her breasts.) (Joey has turned around.)",44
Ross," Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one’s not really our

fault.",13
Monica," I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and

then show it to me.",21
Joey," I’m afraid I’m gonna need proof. 

C'mon, whip it out.",10
Joey," Oh yes I do. Otherwise what’s next? Today I’m just a guy who

can’t finish a turkey, but tomorrow I’m the guy who eats half a Powerbar,

wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just…I just—I gotta change

my pants. (Gets up and heads for the door.) Jeans have no give. (Exits.)",57
Monica," (To Chandler and Phoebe) Alright, guys, 

could you help me with the dishes? There's a lot of pots and pans.",20
Chandler," Oh honey I'd love to but the second 

game's about to start so... (starts to get up)",17
Phoebe," (getting up with him) Oh yeah, the 

second game. More football for the Phoebster",14
Monica," Wow, last time I checked, Los Angeles 

didn't have a football team.",12
Chandler," Did I say Los Angeles? I meant the 

team that used to be in Los Angeles and now in St. Louis. (whispers to Phoebe) I 

actually knew that.",28
Chandler," Gretzky... Agassi (struggles to think 

of a third, then to Phoebe) I'm a pretty little girl. (Monica Throws him a 

tea-towel)",21
Rachel," (entering carrying a book) Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote

in my yearbook senior year, ""Dear Rach, you’re such a good person."" Not

girl! Person!",27
Ross," Rach, I think you’re reading a little too much into it.",11
Rachel," (reading what he wrote again) ""Dear Rach, you’re a great

person. Sorry about your teeney-wienie."" (Will laughs.)",17
Ross," Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the

entire school and tell them it wasn’t true?!",25
Ross," Well look-look I’m not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million

years ago!",14
Rachel," I don’t care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half

and half! Y’know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in

high school.",35
Monica," Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs.

Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.",16
Rachel, Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!,14
Chandler," I’m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a

50-year-old woman?",15
Rachel," Ohh, there’s a picture of her in the yearbook actually.",10
Chandler," Well, she probably wasn’t familiar with the process having spent

most of her life sitting for oil paintings!",18
Phoebe," So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird

dinner?",16
Ross," I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of

us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must

know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace…",45
Ross," Only when it was damp!! (To Rachel) I can’t believe you-you told

people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y’know what? (To Will) I’m back in the

club!",26
Phoebe," I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I

didn’t go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn

French. Bonjour.",31
Rachel," All right, y’know—Fine! You guys have your stupid little club,

but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you!

You gave me a teeney-wienie! (Will laughs.)",39
Monica," All right, listen you’re just being silly. Rachel, even with that

rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you.

One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!",46
Monica," And Ross, if it weren’t for Rachel’s rumor I mean no one in

high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!",27
Monica," Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be

pretty.",16
Monica," Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you’ve been

through so much since then. And right now you’ve got so much more important stuff

going on in your life. Can’t you just let this go?",39
Phoebe," Okay. (Goes over and hugs him.) It’s exactly how I’d imagined

it would be.",14
Joey," (entering, wearing the maternity pants from earlier) All right

where’s that turkey!",12
Joey," Well that’s it. I’m done. Whew! (Wipes his forehead.) There come

the meat sweats. (Chandler hands him a towel and he wipes his face.)",24
Chandler," Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.",14
Joey," Ah, just cut me a little sliver. (Monica prepares to cut a little sliver.)

A little bigger. (Monica prepares to cut a bigger piece.) Little bigger. (Monica moves the

knife again.) What?! Are you afraid you’re gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!",44
Chandler," New haircut? (Monica nods ‘No.’) Necklace? (No) Dress? (No)

Boots? (Monica nods ‘Yes.’) Boots!",14
Monica," Yes! Now, they’re a little more than I normally spend on

boots…or rent (Shows him the receipt.)",17
Monica," I’m sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman

was looking at me like, ""Oh, these are way too expensive for you.""",25
Rachel, Oh my God! (Notices the boots) Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!,12
Chandler," Yeah well, too bad we’re gonna have to return them.",10
Monica," Honey, I’m not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a

lot, but I’m going to wear them all the time. You’ll see. Besides, I love the

compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?",42
Ross," That’s right, I love you! And-and I’m gonna play with you all

the time.",14
Phoebe, How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?,11
Phoebe," Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, ""I can’t wait to

hear your first words,"" I thought, ""There’s a trick.""",20
Rachel," Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I’ll see you later.",11
Rachel, Bye. (She gets up to leave but is stopped by Joey),11
Joey," Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin’ to my sister and she knows

you work at Ralph Lauren…",21
Rachel," No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren

clothes to prison. It is a waste.",19
Joey," No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she’s

really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y’know, to

give her some advice.",28
Rachel, I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors…,10
Rachel, Yes! I’d love to! Have her come by the office.,10
Joey," Great! Thanks! You’re gonna love her so much. And—Oh, she’s

the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, y’know the S.A.T’s?",21
Phoebe, Hey Ross! Doesn’t Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?,10
Phoebe," You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur

stuff you tell us?!",17
Ross," Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils? (Joey is about to

sit down and hears this so instead he groans and exits.)",25
Ross, What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?,11
Phoebe," No, it’s New York magazine. It’s an article about the

best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?",22
Phoebe," Uh-huh, yeah that’s too bad. I really want to go to his concert

Friday night, but it’s totally sold out. I know! Why don’t you meet him and get

tickets?! If you get two I’ll take you.",37
Ross," Well actually, I’m picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he’ll be

there.",11
Phoebe," There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting

tomorrow! That’s why you have kids!",21
Monica," See Chandler? I’m getting a lot of use out of them already!

They’re very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with

pants…",26
Chandler," You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to

pay for them. (Goes and gets some coffee at the counter.)",26
Monica, The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!,13
Rachel, Well-well you can give them to me! I haven’t felt my feet in years!,14
Monica," I can’t! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that

I’d wear them all the time, I just can’t give them away!",26
Monica," I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little

scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.",21
Chandler," (spinning around looking for him) I don’t think you did a very

thorough job!",14
Ross," I dropped him off at Carol’s. (To Phoebe) Anyway, it turns out that

I’m not going to be able to get those tickets though.",24
Ross, Well it turns out that Ben and Sting’s son do not get along.,13
Ross," Apparently, Sting’s son made fun of the fact that Ben’s moms are

lesbinims.",13
Phoebe," Wait! But Ross if they don’t get along then you should

smooth things over. Make them be friends.",18
Phoebe," Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!",12
Phoebe," Your kid is seven?! (Ross nods, ""Yes."") (To the rest)

He’s really small. (To Ross) Please! Please get the tickets!",20
Phoebe," (singing) Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the

tickets!!",13
Joey," This is so exciting for her. Ralph Lauren 

just smiled at her in the elevator.",15
Rachel," Really? Are you sure it was you because 

he likes it sometimes when the buttons light up.",17
Joey," Well, I’ll let you two fash…ists

get down to business. (To Dina) You, be good. Learn a lot, 

and if she takes you to the freebie room, I need shirts, but none with that 

creepy logo with the guy riding the dog, holding a bone. (Exits.)",46
Rachel," Okay. All right Dina, well let’s talk about the different areas of

fashion that you could get involved in. Let’s see, there’s design, but you may

need a whole other degree for that. Uh, there’s-there’s sales, which is great

because you get to travel…",44
Monica," Oh nothing I’m just—just was yawning. (Mimics the groan from

before and stretches.)",13
Chandler," Oh don’t forget, my office holiday party is tonight. (They go

into the apartment.)",14
Chandler," Yeah. Oh, I forgot all about the 

Secret Santa gift. (picks up a statue of an owl off the phone table.) do we like 

this?",25
Monica," Honey, we don’t really have to go to this thing tonight do we?",13
Chandler," Now sweetie, I know you don’t like my office parties, but you can

wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a…supple leather lining.",24
Monica," I-I don’t-I don’t think that I’m gonna wear the boots

tonight.",11
Monica," Well y’know, I’m just-I’m just worried that bosses will

see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them

and-and want a raise!",30
Chandler, Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?,12
Monica," Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the

boots don’t really go with it.",21
Chandler," You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with

skirts, dresses, and pants! What are you wearing? A 

chicken suit?",24
Monica," Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I’ll wear the boots. In

fact, I’ll go into my room right now and y’know try the outfit on.",28
Monica," Okay? (She starts to walk which causes her to start crying) Ooo wee!

Christmas party in my boots! (Runs into the bedroom and mixes saying ‘ow’ with

laughing.)",28
Rachel," Honey, it’s going to be okay. He’s been incredibly supportive

of me, and if he gets a little upset; that’s what the meatball sub is for. (She gives

Dina a sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil.)",35
Joey," Hey! It’s my fashion girls! (They don’t react.) What’s

wrong?",10
Rachel," Honey, why don’t you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to

tell you.",15
Joey," (concerned) Oh. What’s, what’s going on? Is it mom? Is she sick?

Is it dad’s heart? Is that a sandwich?",20
Rachel," (To Dina) Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich! (She

quickly sets the sandwich in front of him.)",20
Joey," Well obviously this is a mistake! You can’t be pregnant! Because you

have to have sex to get pregnant!",19
Joey," (to Rachel) Bub!!! (Points at her and quiets Rachel.) (To Dina) I

can’t believe this! You’re the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who

did this to you?!",30
Joey," You got pregnant for funny?! Dina…if he’s funny…laugh!

All right, I’ll be back in a little while! You stay here!",20
Joey, I can’t look at you right now! (Exits and slams the door behind him.),14
Phoebe," Oh, there you are Ben! (Ben looks 

shocked to see her) You're Ban right?",14
Phoebe," Well, I heard you’re having a problem with one of the boys in your

class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little

talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy’s name is Sting’s son.",47
Phoebe," Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they

have famous fathers.",16
Phoebe," Wow, your friend Doug looks a lot like 

Billy Joel. Is that who his father is?",16
Phoebe," Him you’re friends with. (Starts looking at the children trying to

find Jack and a teacher notices her.)",18
Phoebe," I am one of Ben’s mothers. I’m a lesbian. It was, it was

difficult coming out to my parents.",19
Phoebe," Yeah! Let’s do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and

talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?",30
Phoebe," Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? ‘Cause Carol

threw it out, she lost ours. She’s such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of

ass.",30
Monica," Yeah! I didn’t know there would be dancing. That was a fun

surprise!",13
Chandler," I don’t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?",11
Monica," Oh. Well maybe we could commit a crime, 

have 'em pick us up.",13
Monica," Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb

down through the manhole cover?",21
Monica, I can’t walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!,11
Monica," Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them!

They’re killing me! One toe at a time!",20
Monica," I did say you were right sweety. Isn't 

it clear I'm delirious from the pain?",15
Chandler," So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. (Pause)

It’s oddly unsettling.",17
Monica, How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?,10
Chandler," Honey, I don't think me getting on 

your back's gonna improve matters.",12
Monica," Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off

first. (She starts taking them off.) Ah…Ooh…Oohh…Ohh…Oh

God…Ohh…Oh…Ohh…Ohhhh…",23
Chandler," Honey, I know you’re in pain right now, but I’m a little

turned on.",14
Joey," Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join

this man and this woman…",19
Joey," Don’t interrupt me when I’m talkin’ to God! Now where were

we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man…",21
Joey," Ahhh! I heard ""I do"", we’re halfway there! Okay! (To Bobby)

You!",12
Rachel," All right Joey! That is enough! (Grabs him and pulls him away from Bobby

and Dina) Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it’s not legal. Okay?

They-they don’t have a marriage license, they don’t have any witnesses, and the

groom only has on one shoe!",48
Rachel," You’re supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can

make their own decisions.",16
Joey, No they can’t! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!,11
Rachel," Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! (To Bobby and Dina)

Right?",11
Phoebe," Wow! This place is incredible! (Gasps) Sting’s pen…that he

gave to Phoebe. (Puts the pen in her purse and goes over to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase)

Come on! Secret passageway! (Starts pulling books at random as Trudie enters.)",37
Phoebe," Oh, I see. Yeah you see, I think it will 

be better for the children, Y'know if all the parents were here. Except for, 

y'know Ben's birth mother and father.",30
Phoebe," Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night

perhaps at 8 o’clock?",15
Phoebe," Concert. Yeah. That does put us in…quite a pickle. Because you see

I’m very busy before and after the concert, and he’s obviously busy during.",25
Phoebe," Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm,

all the while thinking about the children of course.",23
Phoebe, Oh good! Then you’re in luck! Ben’s not my son!,10
Phoebe, The Police? Here? A reunion?! (She gets out her camera.),10
Monica, (notices something in the window) Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!,10
Monica," My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the

price?",17
Chandler, I can see it from right here. It’ll cost you one husband.,12
Monica," Okay, I’m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now.

Just-just give me my boots.",19
Chandler," Well, why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on

a bale of hay!",18
Monica," Okay. (She gets off him.) God well, we gotta go back and get them!",14
Chandler," Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?",10
Monica," Yes I am! Ok, They're very practical. I 

can wear then with pants or...",14
Monica," Okay, I’m never gonna wear them again. I just didn’t get a

chance to say goodbye.",16
Chandler, Y’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.,10
Monica, (to the boots) Bye boots—Wait! Half off?! (Chandler runs off.),10
Rachel," Joey, just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean

this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!",21
Joey," Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let’s hear their plan! Now, what’s the

future look like for Dina and Bobby?",18
Rachel," Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you

wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don’t you tell us a

little bit about your band?",39
Joey," Dina, if you’re having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to

Bobby! (Bobby gets happy.) Dude, that’s not a compliment!",24
Joey," So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You’re gonna have the

baby and-and raise it by yourself…without a husband?! You can’t be a single

mother alone! You’re gonna ruin your life!",31
Joey," No! No! No! It’s different for you. You’re so strong and

together. You’re not some dumb kid who doesn’t know what she’s doing.",23
Joey," One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.",14
Rachel, So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?,11
Joey," Maybe! (To Bobby) Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb

Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!",17
Rachel," Okay Bobby, why don’t we just come over here and let them have a

little moment. (Drags Bobby away from Joey and Dina.)",23
Joey, Come here! (Hugs Dina and Bobby looks to hug Rachel.),10
Ross," Guess what? (Phoebe starts to scream, then 

to the people who have started to watch them) We're good, we're good, we know 

each other. (sits down) So uh, anyway guess what?",31
Ross, You’re gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!! (Holds up two.),13
Phoebe, Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!,12
Phoebe," Okay, now would you say that that’s more than 50 yards away from

Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?",22
Phoebe," He’s awfully short and I think he’s talking to himself. And to


be completely honest, he’s not that good in bed.",21
Rachel," Really? Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it’s like every guy I


see—I mean look here. (Points behind them) Look at that guy for example, I mean


normally that’s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the


way I’m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.",60
Phoebe," Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?",13
Phoebe," This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start


going crazy.",13
Phoebe," Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so


in, y’know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.",24
Rachel," Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store


sitting on Santa’s lap.",17
Phoebe," Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander


Holyfield from a Foot Locker.",17
Rachel," Well, y’know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I’ll ask her


about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.",23
Phoebe," Yeah. Yeah, that’s what you need a good…pill.
Oh no! Short Crazy Guy recognises me. (Rachel turns round 
to see him) Worst mistake of my life. (As Rachel turns back round, Phoebe mouths 
""call me"" to Short Crazy Guy.",39
Ross," Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona


ice skating?",17
Joey," Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.


(Brushes something off of his shirt and looks around, but doesn’t move from his


chair.)",29
Ross," Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us


together?",13
Joey," I’m missin’ picture time?! (Jumps over to look, Ross glares at


him and he retreats.)",15
Phoebe, (sitting down next to Ross) Y’know she has a face Ross!,11
Ross," I didn't take these ok. I didn't even know 
my camera had a zoom lens.",15
Ross," Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card


y’know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow. Good job pretzel pervert.",32
Phoebe," Wait, I’m-I’m sorry. What’s the big deal about a holiday


card?",11
Ross," Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have


been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!",28
Ross," no really, that would be like a huge step 
forward, and I like things just the way they are. I'm finally in a relationship 
that is not moving too fast. Y'know ordinarily I'd be divorced by now.",37
Joey," Ok, so just tell her you don't wanna send 
out the card. What's she gonna do?",16
Phoebe," This. (As Mona, in a downbeat voice) 
""Oh, okay. I didn't mean to put pressure on you I just thought it would be 
something fun for us to do together. But ok, that's ok.""",34
Ross," Ok, stop, stop, Your right it's not that 
big a deal. I'll, I'll do the card. (Phoebe starts to look sad again) What? What 
I said I'd do it",29
Phoebe," (As Mona again) I know, it's just, can I 
have $20?""",11
Chandler," One second. (He holds up one of them 
paper cut-out people chain things... can't think of any other way to describe 
it)",22
Chandler," I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m


sorry.",11
Monica," I can’t think of anything we’re doing. (Quietly) Why


can’t I think of anything we’re doing?",16
Monica," Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow! (Doug exits.) Just so you know,


we’re not seeing him tomorrow. (Chandler wonders why.)",19
Chandler," Once you get to know him, he's much, 
much worse. I can't do this alone.",15
Monica," I'm sorry, I cannot help you,  I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember 
how he behaved at our wedding?",23
Monica," That’s because he wasn’t invited because of the way he behaved


at our engagement party.",15
Chandler," Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture


doesn’t it?",12
Ross," Well, we-we haven’t said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay


to say it to other people.",20
Ross," A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I’ll take a—Mona, uh…I-I’m


not sure about the whole uh, card thing.",17
Ross," Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don’t know if


we’re really quite there yet.",18
Rachel," Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy


who took my blood sample really cute? Y’know who I’m talking about, bald


haircut, hairy fingers… (Stops when she realizes it was her.) You know what, never mind, I just answered my own 
question.",50
Rachel," Yes, you are. 
(to the nurse) Hey, now he's cute right?",11
Rachel," Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are


you from? What do you do?",18
Rachel," Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you


ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?",26
Rachel," No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!",10
Rachel, Well would you like me to lie down on the table?,11
Rachel," Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the


middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.",25
Phoebe," Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my


fourth month of


pregnancy?",14
Monica," Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you


practically came on to me.",19
Rachel," Okay, even this is turning me on! 
I have problems.",10
Rachel," Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it, how’s it going with you and


Mona? Are you guys still together?",19
Ross," Oh yeah, yeah we’re moving forward. You’ll be getting our card!",11
Ross," Yeah, we’re not just doing a card! Y’know, she-she also wants to


have the conversation about where the relationship is going.",21
Ross," I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I


mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, ""So, where is this going?""",28
Ross," Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I’m not a 
mind reader!",12
Monica," What are you gonna say to her? I mean, 
where is this relationship gonig?",14
Ross," I don't know, I mean I really like her, 
and I wanna keep dating her.",15
Ross," No, I can't. Cause then she's gonna say 
""Well if it's not moving anywhere, then-then, we should just break up.""",20
Ross," Besides, I hate those conversations. I’m 
horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y’know, 
something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk about it.",30
Monica," All right. Have you said, ""I love you?"" You could say, I love


you.",14
Ross," Yeah I-I don’t-I don’t think I’m quite there yet, but I


could say I looove spending time with you.",19
Ross," Forget it. I-I—Y’know what? I’ll just have the


conversation. I’ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best.


What do you think Rach?",29
Rachel," I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples


through that sweater.",18
Chandler," Oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. Monica has to work.",14
Chandler," Well, that's the finals, and I think 
she's gonna go all the way, sir.",14
Chandler," Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold


me.",11
Chandler," Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is


choking something. Can I choke ya?",17
Chandler," Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell with


that bitch.",15
Ross," Here we go. Mona umm, I think it’s time we-we had a conversation


about-about where things are with us.",19
Ross," Aw, we-we are so…(Motions that they’re connected.) So umm, well


I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y’know hanging out with you. And I mean-I’m


having a lot of fun. (He pauses and thinks there might be more, but decides there


isn’t.)",42
Ross," I mean, there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if


it’s just fun. It’s gotta be, it’s gotta be going somewhere right? So


where-where is it going? (Pause) Ah! That’s-that’s the real question. And-and


the answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun. Now I-I know what you’re


thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you’re-you’re


not getting any younger. No I mean—No not you, not you, you—you are


getting younger. I mean—you-you look like you’re getting younger by the


second—What’s your secret?",86
Ross," Well, well to sum up, we’re having fun, you look young.",11
Ross," But that’s not enough. So… So…here’s a key to my


apartment. (Hands her his key.)",15
Ross," Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a


very serious relationship.",21
Ross," She talked me into a corner. Ok, she's 
like this conversational wizard!",12
Rachel," So, you had the conversation you didn't 
wanna have, and you made the gesture you didn't wanna make.",18
Ross," Did I start this by saying ""Hey, I did 
something awesome today!""? Do you have a key to my place?",20
Phoebe, (entering with some guy) Hey. Ooh Ross! How’d the conversation go?,11
Phoebe," So umm, I’m gonna get us some drinks. (To Rachel) Would you help me


out?",15
Monica," Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he’ll have


sex with you.",17
Rachel," No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do


it with some random guy!",22
Phoebe," Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!


(Phoebe exits.)",15
Chandler," Oh that’s all right sir, and that’s just one girl.",10
Chandler," It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a Jack and Coke


holder.",14
Ross," Okay, and oh I’m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give


them away for no reason at all.",21
Ross, I’m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.,11
Chandler," It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that


you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then


when I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!",52
Chandler," Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would


be like without you. It was like It’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please


promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each


other for the rest of our lives.",53
Monica," I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday


card this year?",16
Rachel," Yes. Hi, I’d like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question?


Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch. (Joey


enters.) I’ll call you back.",32
Joey, You hung up on the pizza place? I don’t hang up on your friends.,14
Rachel," I’m sorry honey, I’m just having a, having a rough day.",11
Rachel," Oh you really, you really just don’t want to hear about it.",12
Rachel," Okay, it’s just—and this is really embarrassing—but


lately with this whole pregnancy thing I’m just finding myself…how do I put this


umm, erotically charged.",24
Rachel," Yeah. So y’know, I have all of these feelings and I don’t know


what to do about them, because I can’t date like a normal person, which is fine


because I don’t need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night.


Just sex, y’know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel


comfortable with and who knows what he’s doing. For just one great night, I mean is


that really so…hard…to find. (Looks at Joey.) So how was your day?",87
Rachel," Well, I gotta get up early and it’s almost seven o’clock.",11
Joey," Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.",10
Joey," But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.",10
Rachel," And so bad. I don’t even know what you’re talking about


because I didn’t ask you to do anything!",19
Joey, Get back in there! (Rachel re-enters her room and closes the door.),12
Phoebe," Hi. Listen, I’m sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really


wasn’t right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something


that I think you’ll really enjoy. (Goes into the hallway and returns carrying the


Evander Holyfield cutout.) Now, this is just a loan. Okay? I’m gonna, I’m gonna


want him back. So… (Looks at him longingly) I’m gonna go now. (Exits.) (Pause)


(Entering) I’m sorry, I thought I could do it and I can’t! (She grabs the cutout


and exits for good.)",93
Monica," You mean the thing we went to the store 
for? Nope.",11
Phoebe," I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got


here!",17
Chandler," Pheebs you didn’t have to get us anything for our wedding you


already sang…",14
Monica," (interrupting) I love it! It’s huge!! Let’s open it! Open it!!


(Monica rips open the paper.)",16
Phoebe, I didn’t know where to put it so I just left it here for now.,15
Monica," Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.",11
Monica, All right. (He goes to push it and it doesn’t move.),11
Monica," Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade!


This is like—Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!",23
Monica," Well, you just—you put a quarter in and y’know pull-pull some


handles and win like a candy bar or something.",20
Monica, Don’t feel bad for me! I won like every time!,10
Ross," Hey! Oh, I’m so glad you guys are here. I’ve been dying to tell


someone what happened in the Palaeontology department today.",22
Joey, (To Rachel) Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?,14
Ross," No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes! (Pause) Why 
didn’t I get head of the department? ",19
Rachel," Well that's great, You always wanted to 
teach an advance class.",11
Ross," I know, I know, its really exciting. I 
mean this is the break I've been waiting for. I'm not sure a court-ordered detox 
program is the break Professor Newman was waiting for but yet! (Goes and 
gets some coffee.)",39
Joey," I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?",13
Rachel," Uh, Paul’s Café. They got great food and it’s really


romantic.",11
Rachel," Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons


for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing—Oh! Take her


dancing!",29
Joey," You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I’ll tell ya…",14
Rachel," Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin’ all dressed up and going to a fancy


restaurant. I’m not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it’s so much fun!


I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not


fun.",49
Rachel," What?! Joey, you don’t want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.",14
Joey," Yes I do! And we’re gonna go out, we’re gonna have a good time,


and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching


out…",29
Rachel," (interrupting) Okay! I’ll go with ya! I’ll go! I’ll go


with ya.",12
Phoebe," No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off


all of your top scores, how sad.",22
Monica," Okay, I’m next. (Phoebe starts another game.) Don’t!


Don’t start another game! I said I’m next! Phoebe!",17
Phoebe," Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you over all the winning.",11
Monica, You only think it’s stupid because you suck at it.,10
Phoebe," Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you,


then maybe I should just keep it.",21
Monica," No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don’t you


go home and wait for the thank you card?",24
Chandler, Why do you want to play this game so bad?,10
Phoebe," Yeah! It’s not like it spits out a Clark bar after every


game.",13
Monica," Okay. Phoebe that’s it. Come on, get out—out of the chair. Get


out! (She goes to move Phoebe, but Phoebe goes limp and Monica can’t move her.) Oh


come…Phoebe! Chandler!",30
Chandler," No, no, this is a girl fight. I'm 
hoping it will turn into love play.",15
Monica," Ok look, honey I'm sorry that I'm acting 
hostile, I don't mean to, it's just I love this game so much, that I would like 
a chance to play wit it too.",32
Phoebe," Wow, it's amazing how well I can play 
with you yapping round my head like a Chihuahua.",17
Rachel," Joey? Could you get that? (There is no answer and she goes and opens the


door to Joey.) What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?",30
Joey," No, I’m picking you up for our date. These are for you. (Hands her


some flowers.)",16
Joey," And, a brownie! (Hands her a bag with the brownie in it.) Well, half a


brownie. Actually, it’s just bag. It’s been a long walk from the flower shop and


I was startin’ to feel faint so…",37
Rachel," Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I’m going on a real


date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I’m wearing underwear that


goes up to about…(She snaps the waistband on her underwear that is just slightly


below her breasts)…there.",46
Joey," Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so…nice place you got here.


Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.",28
Joey, I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.,13
Rachel," Ah yes, but he’s very protective of me so you’d better watch


yourself.",13
Joey," Ah… Hey, so this roommate of yours…is he good looking?",10
Joey," Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?",13
Joey," No-no-no-no, he’s not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come


on!",14
Ross," …which brings us back, of course, to Greely’s theory of dominance.


(The bell rings.) Okay, that-that’s all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the


Freeman building is?",29
Ross," What?! That-that’s all the way cross town, I’m supposed to teach


a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.",18
Ross, Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I’m the teacher!!,10
Ross," Hello. (He throws his jacket towards the coat rack and misses.) I’m


sorry I’m a little late. Ah—(Checks his watch)—Whoa! A lot late. Let me


start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller. (The bell rings.) So to sum up,


I’m Professor Geller. Good job today.",48
Rachel," Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute


the three-pound lobster?",15
Joey," Y’know what? Bring her both, and I’ll have the same. (The


waitress leaves.)",13
Rachel," Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date—Oh, I almost


forgot. I didn’t pay you the rent check.",21
Joey," Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We’re on a date.",10
Rachel," Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do


you have any moves?",21
Joey," No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don’t like me for—(Laughs.)


I’m sorry I couldn’t even get through that.",20
Rachel, I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.,12
Joey," Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine


sent to my table from a fan.",21
Joey," Well it does when you combine it with, ""This is so embarrassing, I


just want to have a normal life!""",20
Joey," Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night


to kiss you, but you’re so beautiful…I don’t think I can.",27
Rachel," (looks interested) Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned


in. I really almost did!",17
Joey," Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.",11
Joey," I don’t know. I guess there’s just always been this distance


y’know—I mean we both try to pretend it’s not there, but it is.",24
Rachel," (sympathetic) Oh. (Starts rubbing his wrist with her fingers.) It’s


gotta be rough.",13
Joey," Yeah, it is. It’s really tough. Y’know sometimes I


think—Wow!! Nice move!",12
Rachel," Thank you! And now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go to the rest


room.",16
Chandler, You are not going to believe what I did today!,10
Chandler," I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They


should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. (Pause) Although I-I hope they don’t.",31
Monica," Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man


while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!",23
Chandler," Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the


board! High five! (Holds up his hand to give Monica a high five, only he can’t


straighten his fingers.)",33
Chandler," Well I’ve been playing it for like eight hours, it’ll loosen


up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they’re dirty


words.",28
Chandler," Well y’know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it


is a bit of a challenge.",18
Monica," But clearly your up to the task. Hey wait a minute, this one isn’t dirty.",15
Chandler, It is when you put it together with that one.,10
Monica," Ah, well if you don’t clear this off, you won’t be getting one


of those from me. But Ben’s coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this


can’t be there.",31
Chandler," No-no-no, if you unplug it, I’ll have nothing to show for my day!


It would be like I was at work. (She unplugs it.) No! (And plugs it back in.) Hey look at


that! Look at that, it’s still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM


(Read Only Memory, it’s a memory chip.) Chip in it or something!",61
Monica," Wow, the dirty words and the computer 
talk. This is just the coolest you've ever been. Honey you-you got to beat your scores!",23
Monica," All right fine. Fine, I’ll do it. I’ve just got to get this


off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.",29
Chandler," (smiles) Pull my finger—(Looks at his hand)—My hand is


messed up.",11
Joey," Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if


you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?",24
Rachel," No one! They are my friends, I wouldn’t punch any of them.",12
Rachel," Yeah, but I don’t know why. Look at me, I’m having such a


wonderful time!",15
Joey," Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!",18
Joey, I never laughed so hard—Did you see the wine come out of my nose?,14
Rachel," Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.",12
Joey," I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so


much.",17
Rachel, Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.,14
Rachel," All right, now don’t judge me. I normally wait until my date


leaves, but you live here. I’m ripping into this swan.",22
Joey," Ah! Okay, well then you don’t judge me. I’m gonna suck on the


cellophane from the brownie I had before. (They both do as they planned.)",26
Rachel," So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani’s end of the night moves?",12
Joey," Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips


look irresistible. ",20
Joey," Now you can’t tell anyone, but uh…I put on shiny lip balm.",12
Joey," Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I’m telling ya. Okay all right, so now


you go.",17
Joey," More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! (Rachel just looks at


him.) I didn’t say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just


tell me!",28
Rachel," (laughs) Okay. All right, stand up. (They do so.) Well, when we’re


at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a


second, and then I make this sound, ""Hmmm."" Okay, I know it doesn’t sound


like anything, but I swear it works.",52
Joey," (stunned and turned on) Yeah. Why—Yeah, that would work for ya…",11
Rachel," All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.",14
Joey," Oh. (She kisses him.) Yeah. (She goes into her room.) Me to. (He then


starts to freak out.)",18
Rachel," …you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!",13
Ross," No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the


phrase, ""Get the hell out of my way!""",22
Ross," Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets


it’ll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I?


Rockefeller?",32
Rachel, Well you’re not gonna be able to keep doing this.,10
Ross," Well I have to. Okay? If I don’t, they’ll take the class away


from me. And…I already put it in my family newsletter.",23
Ross," Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I’m sure I can


make it this time. I just…I just can’t be afraid to get a little bit…hit by


cars. (He goes to the bathroom as Joey enters.)",39
Rachel," Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?


",13
Joey," Oh yeah, I still can’t believe you haven’t seen Cujo.


What is wrong with you?",15
Rachel," Yeah I know it’s really boring, but it’s like a big deal.


Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.",20
Rachel," After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?",11
Joey," Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!",14
Rachel," I don’t know! (Pause) I’m-I’m kinda thinking it-it was


the lobster…",11
Joey," Yeah well that’s because uh…I stayed in my room. Yeah, you


don’t want to look in my hamper.",18
Monica," Okay, I got that. I’ll escape over there. I’ll come back over


here. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. It’s got—Right—(She dies.)


Well, you’re just a little bitch, aren’t you?",30
Phoebe," (entering) Hey, you guys. Listen, I’m sorry that I was hogging the


game before but if you don't get off now, I will cut you.
(Sees the top ten list)—Oh my God! Your friends have some


unfortunate initials!",38
Chandler, I did. (Looks at his still deformed hand) But it came at a price.,14
Monica, But Ben is coming over tonight and he can’t see this.,11
Chandler," Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. (They both


look at him.) Was it just me?!",20
Ross," So, we're about out of time. Now, I know 
I've given you a lot of new information (starts doing stretches) and it may seem 
a little overwhelming (stretches some more, and moans with the pain) ...but if 
there's one thing you need to take away from class today... (stretches more) 
it's that dinosaurs ain't never comin' back. I'll, uh, see you next time. (He 
grabs his bag and coat and runs out the class)",74
Ross," Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! I’m on time! (Grabs a bottle of water from a


student, takes a drink, and splashes some on his face like the marathon runners do.) Okay,


why don’t we all uh, (Exhales loudly) open our books to page 23. Where… (Exhales


again) Where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots. Okay, (Closes his


book.) umm, why don’t, why don’t you all start to read, while I—(Passes out


and collapses.)",75
Joey," This is so embarrassing. I just wanna have 
a normal life.",11
Joey," It is? (getting a bit angry) That's funny, 
my fans don't normally do that. (The waitress leaves smiling.)",18
Joey," No-no! I’m fine. It’s just… Hey, can I ask you something?


Have you ever looked at someone that you’ve known for a while and then


suddenly…suddenly see them a different way?",31
Joey," (deadpan) Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I’m talking


about.",13
Joey," Oh yeah, sure. (She gets up, walks towards the bathroom, and Joey watches


her go.) Ehhh.",16
Chandler, One more score to go! You can do it! (Touches her shoulder.),12
Chandler, All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!,10
Phoebe," I can’t!! I can’t!! (She dies.) Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a


bitch!!!!! ",12
Phoebe, Oh hi Ben—No!! Don’t look at the machine! (Covers the screen.),11
Joey," Hey, did you get to the part where they’re trapped in the car and


Cujo’s throwin’ himself at the windshield?",20
Rachel," No! No! Seriously, what’s wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what


are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?",23
Rachel, Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?,13
Rachel," Y’know, I never thought I’d say this about a movie, but I


really hope this dog dies. (Joey brings over a stool at sits on it next to Rachel


who’s in the big chair.) What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect


me.",46
Joey," Oh sure, yeah, why not? (Sits on the arm of the chair.)",12
Rachel," Okay. (Pushes play.) Okay, that’s him! That’s him! That’s


Cujo! That’s Cujo!",12
Joey," All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it’ll be okay.",10
Rachel," Oh my God….What’s he gonna do now? I can’t watch! (Drags


Joey closer to her and cowers into his chest.) Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this?


Aren’t you scared?",30
Ross," So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now,


the hadrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. (He moves to the map and we


see why he made it to class on time, he’s wearing in-line skates and hasn’t


taken them off.) Here. (Points to the map, somewhere in the Middle East, then spins on the


skates and points to the map.) Here. (China.) Now as for the hydrosaurs… ",76
Chandler," C'mon, come back here and talk to me,
mon frére (That's French for my brother)",15
Phoebe," How do I keep losing at tic-tac-toe? 
(she starts to take the pieces off the game board)",17
Rachel," Oh no no, honey. My circle always stays 
in the middle",11
Monica," (opens the door wearing a robe, but leaves the chain on) Hey,

what’s up?",14
Phoebe," Okay. (Monica closes the door, gets the guitar, and then hands it out.)",13
Phoebe, Great! Umm…(Monica closes the door again and Phoebe knocks again.),10
Phoebe, Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?,10
Phoebe, Oh my God! You’re getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!,13
Monica," Phoebe, I can explain! You see..... God! 

I gotta get better at lying.",13
Phoebe, I can’t believe this! How long as this been going on?,11
Phoebe," Okay—Oop! Too late! I’m leaving! Come on Chandler let’s

go! (She storms out.)",13
Chandler," Well, Phoebe I thought I’d—(Off Phoebe’s

look)—Yeah, what the hell. (Exits with Phoebe.)",13
Joey," Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, we’re

almost there! We’re almost there!",18
Rachel," Oh Joey, I’m so happy things worked out for us that we’re

having this baby together. I love you so much.",21
Rachel," And I hope it’s not an inappropriate time to say this but,

you’re the best sex I ever had.",19
Joey," That’s always appropriate! (Back to the matter at hand) Oh, okay. One

more push! One more push!",17
Ross," (crying) I hope you’re a better father than you’re a friend!!

(Cries again and Joey wakes up in horror.)",19
Rachel," Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel

this?!",15
Joey," Oh, y’know what? Maybe uh, you…you should come to me. I’m a

not, I’m not wearing any bottoms.",18
Rachel," Oh, okay! (She goes over to him and he feels her belly.)",12
Rachel," Aw, it’s unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she’s

like umm…oh…who’s that kind of annoying girl soccer player?",20
Monica," Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they

don’t like us do they? (They gave them a polka-dotted punch bowl.)",26
Chandler," Who says you can’t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks?

Maybe we can take it back?",19
Monica," No, it doesn’t say where it came from. Where would we return it?",13
Monica," We can't do that. What if they come back 

for a visit?",12
Chandler," Let's cross that bridge when my aunt 

and uncle who I haven't seen in 15 years drop by unexpectedly and demand a 

gigantic bowl of punch.",26
Monica," No! That’s where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely

forgotten everything you learned at orientation?",17
Chandler," How about the closet by the bathroom? (The secret green door by the

bathroom.)",14
Monica," Oh, okay. Here, why don’t you let me do it?",10
Chandler," Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and

relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. (Tries the door.)

It’s locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?",41
Chandler," Oh y’know, I’ve been living here a while and I’ve never

seen what’s inside that closet. What is, what is in there?",22
Monica," Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me

you-you’ll let it go.",17
Monica, Thank you! (He tries the door again and Monica glares at him.),12
Chandler," Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like

three years. (Phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and Monica glares at him.) If! I said,

""If it helps!"" (Goes to the bedroom.)",36
Monica," Well it’s…I mean I’d just—I’d be

self-conscious. You’re my friend; I’d be naked.",13
Phoebe, Monica! We lived together for years! I’ve seen you naked!,10
Monica," Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.",14
Phoebe," But I’m a professional! And I’m really good! Look, if

you’re uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?",22
Phoebe," It does! How would you feel if you couldn’t share your cooking?

Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn’t teach us about dragons.",25
Ross," What?! It is?! (He tries to quickly remove his gloves, but runs into

trouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabs

Rachel’s belly.)",33
Rachel," It’s not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do

(Mimics him) that again.",17
Rachel," Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey’s room and he was

sleeping…",16
Ross," My God, the baby’s kicking. That’s great. Although I…kinda

wish I-I would’ve been there to feel the kicking for the first time y’know.",23
Joey, Well I got stuff going on in here (Rubbing his belly) if you wanna feel.,15
Ross," Look, I-I don’t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So…Here.

Here’s my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it!

I’ll be there! Okay? I don’t care if it’s three in the morning and all you

want is ice cream.",43
Phoebe," (in a soothing voice) Great, let’s begin. (She starts the massage.)

How’s the pressure?",14
Phoebe," Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it’s not weird is it.",12
Monica, (in a sexy voice) Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah! ,11
Monica," Oh God Phoebe!! (Phoebe covers one ear.) Oh that’s it! That’s

it! Right there! Oh! (Tries to cover the other ear.) Ooooh-oooh-ooooh… (Covers both

ears and continues the massage with her elbows.)",32
Chandler," I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I wasn’t trying to open

your closet! I swear! (Running into the kitchen and sees its Joey.)",24
Joey," Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?",13
Chandler," Monica has a secret closet and she won’t let me see what’s

in it.",14
Chandler," I don’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I

can’t see?!",15
Joey," Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she’s having her cake and 

eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too.",26
Joey," I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was

behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs

came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y’know it wouldn’t kill ya to

respect your wife’s privacy! (He walks away and into his apartment and looks the

door.) Stupid closet full of bugs!",67
Rachel," Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I

don’t—Whoa!! (Winces in pain.)",14
Joey," Oh hey whoa-whoa, don’t worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant

they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.",23
Joey," Absolutely. But, we’re gonna stop by the hospital just to be

sure, okay? I’ll page Ross on the way. Come on.",21
Joey," Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything’s gonna be

fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. (Rachel grabs his hand.) Oww crushing

bones! Good thing we're going to a hospital. Open it (the 

door) open it, Watch your feet, there's bug everywhere.",47
Rachel," Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you’ve had one of these Braxton

thingies?",14
Rachel," Thank you doctor. (Dr. Long exits.) (To Joey) Oh thank you for being so

nice and calm.",17
Joey," Calm?! I wasn’t calm! I’ve never been more scared in all my

life!",13
Rachel," Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor’s uterus

though. Mild discomfort, what’s he talking about?",19
Ross," Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?",13
Ross," Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don’t even feel them.",10
Ross," Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie

theater.",17
Ross," (To Joey) So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.",12
Joey," Oh hey, don’t worry about it man. Don’t worry about it, no big

deal.",14
Ross," Yeah but still, I mean it should’ve been me. I’m the dad.",12
Joey," Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! (Grabs Ross around the shoulders.) He

brought Twizlers!",17
Joey," Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?",11
Chandler," Yeah. (Checks his hair.) Oh no wait, I’m not an nine-year-old

girl.",12
Joey," Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any

day now. (Chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to Joey.) Wow, you sure found

that quick. (He tries the pin in the lock.) I just—I wish I didn’t feel this way

about Rachel anymore, y’know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love

living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think…I

think Ross feels left out. Y’know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the

doctor thought I was the father. God… You should’ve seen the look on Ross’s

face. (Pause) By the way, I have no idea what I’m doing here. For all I know I’m

just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?",144
Chandler," Okay. (They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.) So uh,

Ross is kinda bummed huh?",18
Chandler," Well, it’s not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to

the hospital? Y’know? You’re doing nothing wrong. (Pause) Except for harboring 

an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. ",36
Chandler," Richard? If-if you’re in there, could you pass me my credit 

card?",12
Monica," I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!",12
Monica," So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?",12
Phoebe," Okay. Okay but you should know though, I’ve raised my rates to $200

an hour.",15
Phoebe," Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to

hurt you and it just spurred you on.",23
Monica," What?! You’re crazy! There’s nothing sexual about the noises I

make!",11
Phoebe," Really? There’s nothing sexual about this? (Sexily) Oooh. Oo God!

Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. (Some cute guy is watching closely.) (To him) What are you looking at?!

(Pause) I mean hi.",30
Monica," That's why Alexandra wears ear-plugs 

when she gives me a massage. It's not because she hates Enya! Oh my—This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I’m never gonna get

massaged again!",31
Phoebe," No, you can’t let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I

have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!",26
Phoebe," Well not clients, lovers. But let’s just y’know, try it again.

Come back and-and we’ll work through it.",18
Phoebe," Great! Okay, if you’ll just excuse me. (To the guy) So, did you

hear something you liked?",17
Rachel, Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!,10
Ross," Y'know, if you stuck one hand down your 

pants, you're the spitting image of Joey. Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.",22
Rachel," Ohh! That’s so sweet of you! Oh yum! (Takes a bite out of the

sandwich and starts to get sick.) Did you put pickles on this?",26
Rachel, Oh Ross!! (Runs to the bathroom and closes the door.),10
Joey, Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.,13
Ross," (to Rachel) I-I’m sorry Rach, I didn’t know. Are you gonna be

okay?",13
Rachel," Yeah, I’ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that

sandwich is gone when I get out there?",19
Joey, I’m on it! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich.),10
Ross," I can’t believe this! I shouldn’t be the one making her throw

up!",13
Ross," Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don’t know any of it

and I’m the father. I wish I’d be more involved y’know.",26
Rachel," (entering) Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.",12
Joey," Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?",13
Joey," The thing is…’cause I live with Rachel I’m here for a lot

of the stuff, okay? (To Rachel) And Ross…Ross is missing everything. So…",24
Rachel, Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?,13
Joey," Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that…if

you’re gonna have a roommate, y’know it might as well be the father.",25
Rachel," But Joey, I don’t think Ross wants me to move into his apartment

and disrupt his life like that. I mean—(Ross turns to her with wishful eyes.)—Or

he does.",29
Ross," No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just

try it like on a temporary basis.",23
Ross," So? Sure! But it-it wouldn’t be anything romantic. And

I’m-I’m dating Mona—Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour

ago! What is wrong with me?!",28
Rachel," Living with the father of the baby is a 

little conventional for us.",13
Ross," hey, you always have liked my building. 

And... there's more room, I mean, you could have a closet deicated to shoes.",21
Rachel," Oh, you do know your audience I don’t know. Is it crazy?",12
Ross," No! No it’s not. Joey, this is a smart idea.",10
Ross," Oh Rach that’s great. That’s great. (They hug and Joey breathes

a sigh of relief.) And you know what, don't worry about 

any of the moving, I'll take care of everything. In fact, I'll start right now 

(starts to take his jacket off.)",43
Chandler," Not to shabby, I got this all off myself…using my wife’s

tools. (He takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see what’s behind the

green door! It is stacked, floor to ceiling, with junk.) Oh my God!",41
Monica," No Chandler, you don’t understand! 

You know how I organise everything? Right, well this is all of the stuff that 

doesn't fit into any category. So you see, I'm not messy I'm just so 

organised that... (Chandler starts singing the

theme for Sanford and Son, an old TV show starring Redd Fox.) Okay! Okay! Okay!

Fine! Now you know. Okay? I’m y’know…I’m sick.",63
Chandler," No, honey you’re not sick! Look, I don’t love you because

you’re organized, I love you in spite of that.",20
Chandler," Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around

can we, can we share the closet.",22
Chandler, So Rachel’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?,11
Joey," Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because

Rachel couldn’t stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice

with calcium though. And uh, it’s a couple weeks past it’s expiration date, so

it’s got a bit of a kick.",55
Joey," Are you kidding me? I’m great! Yeah, I’m uh; I’m better

than great. I am good. And now that she’s gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff

around here that I couldn’t do before. Y’know? Like umm, I can walk around naked

again. Y’know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this

is good for me. Y’know? I like being on my own, I’m uh, better off this way.

I’m uh, a lone wolf. Y’know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What’s a

wolf got to do to get a huh around here?! (Chandler rushes over and hugs him.)",110
Phoebe," Yeah, say my name. Say it! (She stops when she realizes what 

she’s doing.) And now I’m going to cover you back up, and umm won't be speaking 

with you for several weeks.",33
Monica," So how do you guys like living together 

so far?",10
Rachel," Yeah. But Ross is more uptight about 

crumbs than you are.",11
Monica," And I am not uptight about crumbs. It's 

just that, y'know, crumbs attract mice and mice leave droppings and that's how 

the plague started. So... If you wanna relive that again",31
Rachel," Mice didn't start the plague, rats did. 

Rattus Norvegicus to be exact. (realises what she just said) Oh good God Ross. 

Nick at Nite, once in a while. All right, I'm going. Bye. ",33
Monica," Phoebe, can you stay here, I wanna get 

your opinion on something.",12
Ross," So, I just have to plan the perfect night. 

What's the best date you ever had?",16
Phoebe," Last year, Greg Hayman took me to a very 

nice sushi dinner, then we took a romantic walk to a nearby research lab, where 

we trashed the place and free 20 monkeys.",32
Ross," I knew it! I knew I wasn't crazy! Last 

year a monkey DID attack me attach me at the bus stop.",21
Phoebe," Ok, he's watching us, so just look happy 

ok? (she smiles and waves at the dog, then laughs. Joey joins in half-heartedly)",22
Monica," honey, she may not have to watch it, but 

she's going to have to do it.",16
Rachel," Ok, sure, but you leave a drumstick 

under there and your a bad roommate. ",14
Joey," No, I only say that.... so that uh, 

Chandler won't feel threatened because I'm his only friend.",17
Ross," (closes the door) Did you um—I’m sorry, did you just say

it’s Rachel?",13
Joey," (startled) Yeah, okay but look, buy uh—Hey-hey, y’know,

y’know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn’t get said enough. I like you Ross.",24
Ross," It’s not a big deal? Oh, I’m sorry I just…um, I…what

about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like—you-you can’t

stop thinking about her. Like how you can’t sleep?",34
Joey," I’m an actor, y’know? As-as a group, we tend to be over

dramatic.",13
Joey," Look no, I-I know it’s bad, and I know it’s wrong. Okay? But-but

it’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen. Y’know? These-these are just

feelings, they’re gonna go away.",29
Chandler, Oh! (Puts his hand on her belly.) She’s growing inside you.,11
Chandler, I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.,10
Phoebe," Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?",12
Rachel," Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there

for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why

I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.",42
Chandler," No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each

other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don’t think they exist.",30
Phoebe," Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other

half.",18
Chandler," Come on, don’t be crazy. (To Rachel) You don’t think

there’s someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks at

him.)",26
Chandler," A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!",11
Rachel," Oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.",11
Chandler," Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re

talking about.",12
Phoebe," Oh, I’m so sorry. Um, and maybe I’m wrong! I

but—y’know I’m gonna go out with him again, I’ll find out more.",22
Chandler," You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re

still gonna date him?",16
Phoebe," Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s gotta eat.",13
Monica," I just talked to Joey, I just—I want to see how you were.",13
Ross," Oh y’know, I still—I can’t believe it. Joey and Rachel I

mean it’s… It’s like you and me going out, only weirder!",22
Monica," All right, I know you’re hurting, and-and I want to be supportive,

but don’t say that again.",17
Ross," Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he’d be the

stepfather of my child.",18
Monica," Honey, I don’t think that’s something we need to worry about!

First of all he’s-he’s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if

he did you have no idea how she’d react.",36
Ross," Sure, because women never like Joey. Y’know, I think he’s a

virgin.",12
Monica," No! All he’s thinking about is how you’re taking this! I mean,

listen it’s totally freaking him out. He’s talking about moving to Vermont.",24
Monica, He says he wants to leave the country. (Pause) He thinks you hate him.,14
Ross," Hate him? I… No, I don’t hate him. (Pause) It’s just

it’s Rachel, y’know?",14
Monica," Honey I can’t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I

don’t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that

you’re still his friend.",35
Monica," All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars

into Vermont money.",18
Chandler," What’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.)

On a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still there’s staring.) No?",18
Monica," Oh my God! That’s my restaurant, I’m the chef there.",10
Monica," Oh, I’d like a latte. Oh y’know what? If you’re gonna

talk about me, I’m gonna go with you. ",19
Phoebe," Nothing! I swear to God I didn’t know you guys would be here! And

the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. So…",25
Chandler," I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!",11
Phoebe," They’re just talking, and y’know what? Just because I think

they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen.",18
Monica," Yeah! Oh he’s great, I love him. (Walks away and Chandler glares at

Phoebe.)",14
Joey," Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.",13
Ross," No, no I don’t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to

tell you that I’m not mad at you and…and that I certainly do not hate you. I

just, I just came here to say that. (Starts to leave.)",44
Joey," Oh now—Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or

something?",13
Joey," Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel

left. I don’t…",19
Joey," (pouring two glasses) Hey look Ross, you need to understand something

okay? I uh…I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do

anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. (He hands Ross a glass.)",39
Joey," Anyway, it uh…look it’ll just…take me a while to get over

her, that’s all. I’m not even sure how to do that, I mean I’ve never been

in love before so…",31
Joey," Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don’t want to feel this way. Honest. I

just keep thinking, ""Ah, I’ll get over this."" Y’know? I just—It

just keeps gettin’ harder. I don’t, I don’t know what to do. Y’know?

What do I do?",43
Ross, I think you need to tell her how you feel.,10
Ross," No, I’m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if

she’s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.",26
Joey, But what if uh—and I’m not saying she will be—But…,10
Ross," If she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it

shouldn’t stand in the way.",18
Ross," Yeah. Look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is

she couldn’t find a better guy. So…",20
Ross, So when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?,10
Joey," Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven’t even thought about what I

will say. What should I say?",21
Joey," I’m sorry, you’re right. What am I gonna say? (He takes another

sip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.) Oh!",23
Ross," Yeah, tell me about it. (He stands up, turns his back to Joey, and enjoys

another sip.)",17
Chandler," Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?",10
Chandler," Cheese, it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.",12
Monica," Me too! Yeah, Chandler can’t stand it. He won’t even allow me

to have blue cheese in the house.",19
Monica," You know what I’d love to do? I would like to go to France and eat

nothing but bread and cheese—Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah.

Ah, and pastries… (Breathlessly) And pate. Oh, I’m really not high, it’s

just I used to be fat.",49
Chandler, (disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?,11
Phoebe," I don’t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I

don’t know how you fight that.",20
Joey," Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand

up straight. (Does so.) Take a couple deep breaths. (Does so.) Look confident. (Does so as

Rachel opens the door and startles him.)",40
Joey," I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.",15
Rachel," Well honey, I’m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?",14
Joey," Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I…want to have dinner with

you tonight. That’s all.",19
Rachel," Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to

meet you. Okay? (Walks away.)",19
Joey," Okay. That’s good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what

you’re gonna say. Good. Yeah. (Someone comes out of his apartment and it startles

Joey again.) Don’t you people ever knock?!",34
Monica, I’d like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn’t that be nice?,12
Chandler," Sure, why don’t you set it up. I’ll just be over here,

browsing through the personals.",16
Chandler," Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don’t believe in

that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won’t stand in

your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.",47
Monica," No. I don’t think that you and I were destined to end up together.

I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really

hard.",33
Chandler, So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?,12
Monica," No, I’ve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard

that would be to clean?",17
Chandler," Y’know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I

found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monica

doesn’t look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so good.",36
Rachel," …and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he

touches my stomach. I mean I’m really worried the baby’s not going to like him.

(Joey is staring at the table.) Are you okay?",36
Joey," What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason…(Exhales

slowly)—Is it hot in here?",15
Rachel," No. Not-not for me, but why don’t you take off your sweater?",12
Joey," I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin

doing Hobbs.",18
Joey," Yeah. Sure. (They both half stand up, Joey pulls the neck of his sweater

out, and Rachel looks down it to see his T-shirt.)",24
Rachel," Huh. Wow, I wouldn’t think Hobbs would like that so much.",11
Rachel," Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I

said, ""Eight years."" And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and

umm…now here we are.",35
Joey," Yeah, here we are. Uhh… I… I think I’m…falling in love

with you.",13
Rachel," (looking around) Who are you talking too? Oh, you’re kidding! 

Oh, it’s a joke! (Laughs.) It’s funny. It’s funny. I don’t get it. (Joey doesn’t 

say any thing and Rachel realizes it’s not a joke.) Oh. (Pause) Okay. Umm… 

I-I…uh, wow. ",41
Joey," Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don’t have to say anything.

You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. (Long pause as Rachel says nothing.) Okay,

you gotta say something!",36
Joey," Yeah-yeah right. That’s okay. That’s fine. That’s uh,

pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it’s no big deal. All right? I think

I’m gonna go. (Stands up.)",29
Rachel," No! Joey please! Please don’t! Please don’t leave like this!

Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! (Starts to cry.)",24
Joey," Don’t start doing that. You can’t do that Rach, ‘cause then

you’re gonna make me do that. (Starts to cry.) Oh, here we go! (Sits down next to

her.)",29
Joey," Oh no-no Rach, please, don’t be sorry. Okay? Don’t be sorry.

(They hug again.) Y’know I was only kidding you.",20
Joey, (hearing Rachel and jumping up with his plate) Oh God! That’s Rachel!,12
Joey," No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s
just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here! (Turns to run to
the bathroom and his bagel falls off the plate onto the floor.) Don’t eat that! (Runs
to the bathroom as Rachel enters.)",46
Chandler, I don’t see him. (To Monica) Do you see him?,10
Monica," I don’t see him. Hey! Maybe he’s in the sugar bowl! (Opens the
sugar bowl) Joey? Nope! (Closes the sugar bowl and they both laugh.)",25
Rachel," Well, I haven’t seen him since that night that he told me how he
y’know… I don’t know, I think he’s avoiding me. Why is that bagel on
the floor?",30
Rachel," Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of
situation?",15
Rachel," All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him
uh…tell him I miss him. (Exits and Joey enters.)",22
Joey," Yeah, a naked bagel game? (Picks up his dropped bagel.) (To Chandler)
Dude, I don’t know. That’s a pretty small hole.",21
Joey," I can’t! Y’know? You guys don’t know what it’s like to
put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.",22
Chandler," (incredulous) I don’t know what that’s like?! Up until I was
25 I thought the only response to, ""I love you,"" was, ""Oh crap!""",24
Monica," Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean
when they’re hungry.",17
Monica," This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to
her again? I mean I know it’s weird, it’s awkward, but you gotta at least try.",31
Joey," Yeah. Okay. (Goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.)
Whoa! (Stops.) I almost forgot this was on your…",22
Phoebe," Okay, so when you’re done with your tea I’ll look at your
leaves and tell you your fortune.",18
Phoebe," Oh yeah, I’ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I was
so accurate. Y’know, and-and y’know, one of the great joys of life is
it’s-it’s wondrous unpredictability. Y’know? And also tea tends to give me
the trots.",39
Phoebe," Okay. (Looks at the leaves.) Ooh, I see a ladder. (Checks the book)
Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.",23
Phoebe," Okay. (Reads the leaves) Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.",11
Phoebe," Oh! (Checking the book) Which can either mean you’re having a baby
or you’re gonna make a scientific discovery!",19
Rachel," Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.",12
Phoebe," Umm… Wow, all right. (Checks the book.) Wow! Yay! Ooh, I’m
gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he’s gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably
not the guy I had a dream about last night. (Points at Chandler.)",41
Ross," (entering) Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It’s a button down, like a,
like a faded salmon color?",18
Ross, Great! Great. Then I must’ve left it at Mona’s. I knew it!,12
Chandler," Well, I’m sure you get another one at Ann Taylor’s.",10
Ross," I don’t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It’s just that we
didn’t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I’d be ignoring
the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. (Walks
away.)",50
Phoebe," (noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) Oh wait a
second you guys…for the last couple weeks I’ve been that guy everywhere I go. We
take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he’s the
tea guy. (He gets up to leave, and smiles at Phoebe.)",57
Chandler," Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!
(Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that
mean?",30
Rachel," So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it’s
not even like we know how to be with each other anymore. 
And by the way, I've been meaning to say this. If you guys knew about this a 
little heads-up would've been nice. Just a little. You know ""Joey loves you, be 
prepared"".",59
Chandler," I know it’s tough now, but things will get better.",10
Rachel," How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to
the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!",30
Chandler," I’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic
comment? Some cheese?",16
Monica," Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?",12
Chandler," Let’s just say if I can’t find the right CD case I just put
it in the nearest one.",19
Chandler," Honey, I’m gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in
the right case.",17
Monica," Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we’re
just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.",27
Chandler," Well, if we’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of
order. Y’know alphabetically or by genre?",20
Monica," Hmm, I don’t know. We really have to talk this through.",11
Rachel, Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!,14
Monica," Okay, I-I’m sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this
uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him
try to get him talking about something else.",36
Monica," Yeah, like I don’t know, maybe you have a work problem that you
need his advice on.",17
Monica," Good. (To Chandler) Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?",10
Chandler," They were just giving those away at the store (off Monica’s look)
in exchange for money.",16
Monica," Uh I really don’t know what to tell you Rach, I really don’t.
I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.",28
Monica," Yeah Joey she’s…Rachel’s got this really big work
problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! (To Chandler) Y’know what, if we’re
gonna make dinner we’re gonna have to leave. Yeah. 
Joey, maybe you could help her out. ",38
Monica," Oh and y'know what, while your helping 
solve this problem, you might want to do something with your hands, like umm, I 
don't know, ff the top of my head err... maybe put the CD's in the right cases.",39
Joey," Huh. Okay. (Awkward silence.) So uh, I think I’m gonna take off.",12
Rachel," Yeah—No wait! Joey no wait it is. It’s something.
It’s-it’s umm…it’s my boss.",13
Rachel," I know I told you, it’s a really big problem.",10
Rachel," Well I’ll tell ya! (Pause) See uh my-my boss and his
wife—They-they can’t have children. So umm, and that—we were at the
Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, ""Rachel, I want to buy your
baby.""",40
Joey," Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured
it was something about maternity leave.",22
Rachel," Ohh! Yeah! (Pause) Yeah that-that would’ve been a much simpler
problem.",11
Phoebe," Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I’m Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have
been seeing a lot of each other lately. ",19
Phoebe," Well, maybe we will. (Starts to walk away.) Oh! (She turns around and
they exchange information.)",16
Ross," Mona? (There’s no answer, so he starts to leave but remembers where
her extra key is. He reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. He
looks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to his
brain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth to
squeal in pain. After dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses the
key to open the door and enter Mona’s apartment.) Okay, if I were a salmon shirt,
where would I be? (thinks of and answer) Upstream. Damn, 
nobody's here for my good ones. (He hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)",133
Chandler," Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies
of the Annie soundtrack.",19
Rachel, Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.,15
Rachel," Oh that’s not important. The point is, I really—I think
everything’s gonna be okay.",14
Joey, Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!,10
Phoebe," Isn’t it funny how we kept running into each other? It’s as if
someone really wants us to be together.",20
Phoebe," Oh okay, well I’m a masseuse, and I used to work at this
place…",14
Phoebe," (a little freaked out) So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone
wildly I guess, for umm—Well since I was fourteen.",22
Phoebe," Okay. Umm look, you’re coming on a little strong. But I’m
going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to
be together. So, why don’t we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about
yourself.",46
Chandler," (singing) The sun’ll come out…tomorrow! Bet…your
bottom dollar that tomorrow… (The girls start laughing, and in a deep voice) …there’ll
be sun.",22
Rachel," Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about
that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.",23
Joey," Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy’s not going to be
bothering you about that baby thing anymore.",22
Joey," Don’t worry! Don’t worry. I just told him, very nicely,
""You don’t go buying people’s babies, so back off!!""",19
Rachel," No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn’t want to buy my baby! I made that
up!",15
Rachel," So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn’t be
awkward!",14
Rachel," (To Joey) I can’t believe that you yelled at my boss!
I’m-I’m gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!",22
Rachel," Oh Joey, I can’t believe you brought my boss into this! I’m
gonna get fired!",15
Rachel," Well, she told me too! (Points to Monica and Joey glares at her.)",13
Ross," Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable. 
Okay then. I'll go. (he starts to leave but comes back and takes the magazine he 
was read with him)",29
Rachel," Well, as long as we are clear about that. (Exits smugly.)",11
Phoebe," I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I
have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult
bookstore, a new grocery store…",43
Phoebe," A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy
and that’s what they gave me? (Looks up) When I get up there I’m going to kick
some ass.",34
Monica," Don’t worry Phoebe, you’re gonna meet someone. If I can meet a
great guy, so can you.",17
Monica," Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland
for me. I’m-I’m gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts. (She
points to and walks over to the electric clothes rack they have.)",42
Phoebe," Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going to
do?",15
Phoebe," A little. (She turns around and looks up.) (To the universe) Now
you’re talking.",14
Monica," (to the clerk) Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?",16
Rachel," It’s all gonna be okay. They’re just so happy that I’m
not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I
understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other
child I should bear.",48
Chandler," Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show
they’re not in the baby buying business.",19
Chandler," Oh I’m sorry, you’re kicking me out of my own living room?",12
Rachel," Joey, I’m really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to
make things…",16
Rachel," It kinda worked. I mean y’know, I don’t know about you buy I
haven’t thought about our thing since all this.",21
Joey," Hey you’re right. Yeah, it’s kinda been like us again a little
bit.",13
Joey," Me too. I mean I…haven’t thought at all about how I put myself
out there and said all that stuff and how you didn’t feel the same way about me
and-and how it was really awkward.",36
Phoebe," Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent’s

anniversary party?",15
Phoebe," Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.",12
Chandler," Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? (Sits up) Who said

that?",15
Phoebe," Yeah, he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for

life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty

girl I am.",32
Monica," (To Ross) Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom

and dad this year?",21
Ross," Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?",13
Monica," Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it’s always really

moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I’m going to make them cry.",26
Monica," No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him,

and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, ""God, your

brother."" Know what they’ll say this year? ""God, you""",39
Joey," Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. (Points to

himself) I’m an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. (snaps fingers)",29
Joey," Are you kidding me? Watch! (Makes funny faces trying to cry) Well I

can’t do it with you guys watching me!",21
Monica," Oh I’m working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it.

Sob fest 2002. Oh, I can't wait to see them cry. Uhh, it's 

not going to be like regular crying. It's gonna be like terms of endearment 

crying.  I am going to reduce my parents into the sniffling quaky masses 

of....I may result anger from my childhood.. Hey check this out. (Hands him a picture.)",71
Monica," It’s a dead dog. That’s Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high

school.",14
Chandler," It’s your parents’ anniversary and you’re going to talk

about their dead pet?",13
Monica, You got a present for my parents. That’s so sweet.,10
Joey," Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a

star named after them. ",16
Joey, And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.,12
Chandler," Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia,

gingham, felt, (Pause) and I think my tentacles may be in here too.",25
Ross," (picking up Chi-Chi’s picture) Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog!

Y’know Monica couldn’t get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.",21
Ross," Uhh, you guys we really should get going.  

Whoops! There I go again, my ""catch phrase."" ",16
Ross," Well, there is an Arby’s in the shape of a tee-pee.",11
Monica," Okay, I got my note cards. (To Chandler) Do you got the presents? ",13
Rachel," This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have

any pearls of wisdom? ",18
Ross, Dad so what we have to pretend that we’re married?,10
Rachel," Yeah, if you’re going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass

at the nosal area.",19
Rachel," No, I know I don’t either, but ya know what, it’s their party,

and it’s just one night. And we don’t even have to lie; we just won’t say

anything. If it comes up again, we’ll just…smile. We’ll nod along.",40
Monica," Thanks! Like I said before I pretty much 

stay in the lines and try not to hit anybody.",18
Chandler," Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge

butterfly net looking for that man.",17
Joey," I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don’t want him complimenting

my thing.",16
Ross, I’m so we weren’t in the car! Did he ever let up?,12
Ross," (imitating Parker) This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must

take a mental picture! (He backs into someone.) Ooh sorry…(He looks behind him then

notices its Phoebe then stops his impression.)",33
Phoebe," Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you’ve dated?

Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don’t do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do

you want it? ‘Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the

who’s who of human crap. (Walks off)",52
Ross," No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small

wedding.",17
Rachel," But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.",13
Rachel," On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn’t

She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.",20
Rachel," So would I. You wouldn’t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to

put film in the camera.",17
Ross," Would you excuse us for a second? (Pulls Rachel off to the side)

Umm…. what are you doing?",18
Rachel," What? I’m not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want

it to be amazing.",19
Ross," Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley. ",11
Phoebe," Okay, fine! Fine! (Takes the oyster and pretends to eat it while

dropping it on the floor) Mmm…hmmmmm….",18
Chandler," I know! I know! (goes over to sit with 

Monica) Listen your family is really starting to warm up to me. ",21
Monica," Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit ‘em. I

can’t wait. They’re going to be crying so hard. They’re going to be

fighting for breath. ",30
Chandler," Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could

(Punches the air).",18
Rachel," And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.",10
Rachel," Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even

though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.",24
Rachel," Well, I don’t know about that, but some said that I looked like a

floating angel.",16
Ross," Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium.

That’s-that’s where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room

filled with lilies, her favorite flower…",31
Ross," Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the

sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the

dome in the stars were the words ""Will you marry me?""",41
Rachel," And the ring, was the size of my fist (makes a fist)!",12
Joey," Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were

being jerks. Parker’s a nice guy and I’d like to get to know him.",28
Phoebe," You guys were right. He’s just too excited about…everything. I

mean I’m all for living life, but this is the Geller’s 35th

anniversary. Okay? Let’s call a spade a spade this party stinks.",33
Joey," I know I’m having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the

buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!",30
Joey," I guess it could’ve been, I didn’t really look at it.

Y’know, I just wiped it on Chandler’s coat and got the hell out of there.",26
Phoebe, He’s just such a great guy I’m so excited about him.,11
Joey," Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There’s nothing wrong with

him he’s a good guy. ",17
Joey, Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.,15
Phoebe," You’re right. You’re right, he’s just embracing life. We

could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I’m a

sunny, positive person. ",31
Phoebe, Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!,11
Monica," Okay it’s time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually

gives the toast, but this year I’m going to do it.",24
Monica," No, no it’s going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got

married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two

of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I

probably don’t say it enough, but I love you. (Pretends to cry hoping her parents

will join her.) When I look around this room, I’m-I’m saddened by the thought of

those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be

here, but she can’t because she’s dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how

cute she is. (Holds up the picture and pretends to cry again). Was. (To an old man by the

stage.) Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she’s dead. Okay, her and

Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her

children in Terms of Endearment? (Chandler covers his ears) Didn’t see that?

No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes

these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. (Waits

for people to cry, but doesn’t get any tears.) You people are made of stone!

Here’s to mom and dad! Whatever!",234
Ross," No, of course, Um… Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say…on

behalf of my new bride, Rachel (She turns around and smiles), and myself. Umm, that

if…if in 35 years, we’re half as happy as you guys are, we’ll count

ourselves the luckiest people in the world.",48
Phoebe, Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium? ,12
Phoebe," Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don’t we just um, sit and

relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly! ",24
Phoebe," Shocking! Let’s play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.

(Giggles)",13
Phoebe," But, let’s play this one first. And remember whoever talks first

loses! ",12
Phoebe," Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn’t perfect?

Everything isn’t magical? Everything isn’t a glow with the light of a million

fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker! ",30
Phoebe, You don’t have to put a good spin on everything.,10
Phoebe," No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland,

getting laid! ",17
Phoebe," So long! Don’t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on

your way out! (He exits and she slams the door behind him.)",28
Ross," …and then, we could’ve gone from the ceremony to the reception

with you in the sidecar!",16
Ross," But having a dove place the ring on your finger would’ve been no

problem?",14
Ross," Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I’ve ever made.",12
Rachel," Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?",10
Rachel," Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the

stars! It was…really wonderful! Did you just make that up? ",23
Ross," No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It’s

how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me. ",25
Rachel," Well, that would’ve been very hard to say no too. ",10
Ross," It’s a good thing I didn’t do it, because it sounds like it

would’ve been a very expensive wedding. (Rachel laughs) Okay, good night",24
Ross," Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn’t get messed

up? ",14
Monica," Okay that’s it. I give up. At mom and dad’s 40th

anniversary, you’re the one giving the speech. ",18
Ross," Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a

beautiful speech. ",13
Ross," Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we

did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.

And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there. And

you know what? I think she was. ",55
Monica," (starts to cry) Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it? ",14
Rachel," So, I’m in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest

crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down. (She hands the magazine to

Joey.)",27
Joey," (reading) Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani.

That’s me!! I’m blank!!",14
Monica," How cool is this?! We know three down! I’m touching three down!

(She has her hand on his shoulder.)",19
Rachel, So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?,14
Joey," No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me,

but I said no.",20
Joey," Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I

write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down

the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.",46
Chandler," If only there was something in your head to control the things

you say. (Joey nods his agreement.)",18
Rachel," Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus

y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And

if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don’t know, gal pal Rachel Green?",46
Joey," Fine! All right, I’ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next

table so you can stop me if I y’know, start to say something stupid.",30
Ross," Just then or-or all the time, ‘cause we-we have jobs y’know.",11
Rachel," Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal

Rachel Green. (Excited) Ha-ha! I’m gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just

in the dumb crossword puzzle. (Looks at Joey.) Seriously, proud of you.",41
Chandler," No, we’re just four people with neck problems. You talk like

this. (Out of the sides of their mouths.)",19
Joey," (laughs) Actually, I didn’t know the magazine was paying for it.

Wouldn’t have mattered, I’m doing this for the fans, not for the free food.",25
Joey," Well, there are so many things, it’s hard to pick just one.",12
Rachel," Oh yeah, I’d actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.",12
Joey," In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And I’m also a mento for

the kids.(The gang shake their heads.) Y’know a mento, a role model. (Chandler bites

his fist to keep from talking.)",36
Joey," Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.",13
Joey," Uhh, I don’t believe in these crazy diets y’know, just

everything in moderation.",13
Joey, I’ll take those to go. (To the interviewer) For the kids.,11
Joey," It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn’t

have said. But believe me, that’s not gonna happen today.",24
Joey," Well, I said that I… (The gang jumps up and interrupts him.)",12
Joey," You guys, this is Shelley, she’s interviewing me for Soap Opera

Digest, and Shelley, this are my friends…",18
Rachel," (interrupting him) Hi! I’m gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want

the dirt, I’m the one you come too. This might be Joey’s baby (rubbing her

stomach), who knows? I’m just kidding—Seriously, (leans into the cassette

recorder Shelley is using) gal pal Rachel Green.",45
Ross," (leaning into the recorder as well) Who just lost the respect of her

unborn child.",15
Ross," Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.",10
Rachel," (scoffs at him) Yeah, that’s gonna get you into Soap Opera

Digest. Well I…(leans into the microphone again)…I would just like to say

that Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.",33
Phoebe," Umm, I…I just think you don’t expect someone so hot to be so

sweet.",14
Phoebe," Oh okay, it’s P as in Phoebe, H as in hoebe, O as in oebe, E as in

ebe, B as in bee-bee and E as in (In an Australian accent) ‘Ello there mate!",34
Joey, Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.),11
Joey," All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up and

eats it.)",17
Ross," All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna

be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes

(kisses Joey).",34
Joey," Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I

didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.",31
Joey," Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends.",12
Joey, Really? Me? Wow! I don’t even know any huge gay people!,11
Joey," What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just

looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your

stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!",37
Ross," Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to

face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.",25
Ross," I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little

holiday weight.",15
Joey," Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we

thought it all the way through.",18
Joey," Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.

(Chandler and Ross look at each other.)",23
Joey," Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say,

""Hey, how you doin’?""",19
Joey," I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping.

(The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the

same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses

it. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)",68
Joey," Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right?

Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.",26
Joey," Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?",11
Joey," Bye-bye. (The interviewer leaves and he sits down with the rest of the

gang.) I did it!",17
Joey," Oh, I don’t watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y’know?",13
Rachel," Wow! I can’t believe they didn’t put it in the part where you

said you didn’t watch soap operas.",19
Joey," Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was

pretty nice about that.",20
Joey," Oh yeah, that’s just a little something for my huge gay fan base.

(Winks at him.)",16
Ross," Hey you guys I got some bad news. (He sets the stack of papers down on the

table.)",18
Phoebe," Well that’s no way to sell newspapers. Why don’t you try,

""Extra! Extra! Read all about it!""",17
Ross," No, Monica’s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. (They all

gasp.) I didn’t want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all

the copies I could find. (He hands the paper to Phoebe and they all read it.)",45
Chandler," (counts the stack of newspapers) 2, 4, 

6, 1 million. Yup, you got 'em all. ",15
Joey," Man, this is bad! And I’ve had my share of bad reviews. I still

remember my first good one though. (Quoting) ""Everything else in this production of Our

Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal.""",36
Monica," (seeing the stack of newspapers) Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers!

It must be a good review! Is it great?!",22
Ross," But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.",14
Rachel," Yeah but y’know what they say Mon, ""There’s no such thing

as bad press.""",14
Monica," You don’t think that umm, (reading) ""The chef’s Mahi Mahi

was awful awful,"" is bad press?",16
Joey," Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I’m not just saying

this because I’m your friend, I’m sayin’ it ‘cause it’s the

truth. You’re food is abysmal!",29
Ross," Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this

after…",18
Rachel," (interrupting him) No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have

any of the big stuff we need! We do not have a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not

have a diaper service!",38
Ross," Okay look, there’s nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time.

There’s a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go

there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?",36
Rachel," Okay. Thank you. That’s great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west

10th? Because there’s this really cute shoe store that has like this

little…",24
Ross," (interrupting her) Okay. Okay. If uh, if you’re gonna do this, then

I’m gonna do that. (Points to the bathroom.) So… (Starts for the bathroom.)",25
Rachel," (stopping him) Oh, wait Ross! I’m sorry, one more thing!",10
Rachel," Umm, our situation. Y’know umm, what we mean to each other. And I

mean we-we’re having this baby together, and we live together. Isn’t that,

isn’t that weird?",28
Rachel, I’m just kidding! You can go pee! (He does so in a hurry.),13
Joey," (entering) Hey uh Monica, I can’t remember. Did we say we were gonna

meet here or at the movies?",19
Joey," Sure, I can hang out ‘til I have to meet ya. (To Chandler) What

uh—How come you’re not going?",19
Chandler, I have a job interview I have to get ready for.,11
Chandler," And people say you don’t pay attention. No, this is a much better

job. It’s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical

factoring for other companies.",29
Monica," Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well… (Feeds him a

spoonful of what she’s cooking.) I’m getting my revenge!",22
Chandler," The front page? You really do live in your own little world,

don’t ya?",14
Joey," (stops) Y'know, if I'm going to the movie, 

and you're going to the movie why don't we just go together? Uh, how's that for 

data reconfiguration huh Chan? (snaps his fingers and points to Chandler) 

(Chandler points to his head saying ""Good thinking!"")",43
Rachel," Oh God, I don't know! I want everything 

is so great. I just want everything. (picks up what looks like a basket off the 

shelf) Ooh look at this we need this. ",32
Ross," Have you ever had two people who weren't 

wearing crowns spend this much money here? ",15
Ross," We are having a baby together, but we’re not involved. (The cashier,

a very beautiful woman, looks confused) I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while

ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. (Rachel looks at

him angrily) Or, yes stranger, we’d like this delivered please.",55
Rachel," Oh yeah! Actually, that’s one of the reasons why we’re not a

couple.",13
Rachel," Oh. Oh yeah, don’t get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds

like he’s a doctor, but he’s not.",21
Rachel," Oh my God! I’m standing at a cash register, holding a credit card,

and I’m bored.",16
Rachel," Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost

got something that wasn’t on the list. A whore.",23
Rachel," Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started

flirting with him. Can you believe that? ",19
Phoebe," Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man,

we-we must alert the church elders!",21
Rachel, You don’t understand! You didn’t see how brazen she was.,10
Rachel," No! I’m not! I-I-I just think it’s wrong! It’s-it’s

that I’m—Here I am about to pop and he’s out picking up some shop girl at

Sluts ‘R’ Us!",28
Phoebe, Is that a real place? (Rachel’s stunned) Are they hiring?,10
Chandler," Well, I got a job interview. It’s kinda a big deal too. Its a lot

more money and I’d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.",26
Chandler," Me! I do that. So… Seriously, do I look okay? I’m little

nervous.",13
Phoebe," Yes, when I first met you, you were like, ""Blah, blah, blah.""

I was like, shhh!",16
Phoebe," Well it’s just like you’re trying too hard. Always making

jokes, y’know, you just—You come off a little needy.",19
Chandler, (To Rachel) Did you like me when we first met?,10
Rachel," Chandler, I’m not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from

you. (Gets up and hurries out.)",20
Chandler," (after Rachel has left) She's put on 

so much weight. ",10
Monica," (looks at someone in the classroom) 

There he is! That smug bastard! ",12
Monica," (looks over 

to see who the actual food critic/teacher is). There he is! (both her and Joey 

walk in)  Hi! Umm, I’m Monica Geller, I’m the chef at Alessandro’s.",29
Monica," I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would

like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.",24
Monica," Spoon? (Hands him one and he tastes it.) So, what do you think?",13
Joey," Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there’s a new class

comin’ in.",15
Monica," Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a 

béarnaise has

shallots, shrivel, and most importantly tarragon. ",21
Rachel," All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you

about keeping Ben in your life?",22
Ross," My son? Pretty serious. (There’s a knock on the door and Ross answers

it.) Oh hey Katie! (The cashier from before) What uh, what are you doing here?",28
Ross," Ah, must’ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in

your store.",15
Ross," Oh. (Reaches into his pocket for some money as Rachel enters the living

room and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.)",20
Ross," Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I’m just gonna put this (The

money) back in my pocket, pretend that didn’t happen. Uh yeah, actually

I’m free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or…",35
Rachel," Horny bitch. (They both look at her, pretending that the dinosaurs

she’s holding are arguing.) No! You’re a horny bitch! Noooo! You’re the

horny bitch! No! You’re a horny bitch! So you guys go, have a really good time.",39
Ross," (To Katie) Yeah, I’m just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip.

(Katie looks worried.) Y’know because of the Indiana Jones? (Katie laughs) Not-not

because I’m-I’m into S&M. (Katie’s worried again.) I’m

not-I’m not into anything weird. Y’know? Just-just normal sex. (Katie is

uncomfortable.) So, I’m gonna grab my coat. (Does so, leaving Katie and Rachel

alone.)",59
Rachel," So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.",13
Rachel," Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you

missed a button.",18
Chandler, I can’t even believe this! I really come off that badly?,11
Phoebe," Oh! It’s okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see

how really sweet and wonderful you really are.",22
Chandler," Oh good. Good, because I’m sure this interview is gonna last a

couple of weeks.",15
Phoebe," All right, don’t freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How

long before you have to leave?",17
Phoebe," All right, all right, we’ll just do our best. Okay? So let’s

say I’m the interviewer and I’m meeting you for the first time. Okay. ""Hi!

Come on in, I’m uh, Regina Philange.""",33
Chandler," Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. (Pause) I’ll let myself out.",12
Joey," When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?",12
Monica," Oh no! I don’t know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone

what it’s called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.",25
Monica," I-I-I’m sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn’t hear what

you said. Umm, hats off to who now?",18
Chandler," …I think you’ll find if I come to work here, I don’t

micro-manage. I don’t shy away from delegating.",19
Phoebe," Um-hmm, that’s good to know. But let’s stop focusing on what

you don’t do, and start focusing on what you do do.",22
Chandler," (suppressing a smile) What I do do…is manage to uh, create an

atmosphere of support for the people working with me.",21
Phoebe, I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.,12
Phoebe," Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you’ll be

great.",11
Joey," I know. I made them all by myself. 

I mixed the ingredients. I put them in the oven and took them out. Granted I 

should have used the oven mitts but still. ",32
Monica," Y’know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of

fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me

the star. (Hands it to her.)",35
Monica," Wow! A star! (The class glares at her.) I know you all hate me and-and

I’m sorry, but I don’t care.",21
Joey," I can an A? In-in school? (To Joey) Hey, I’m a dork.",12
Monica," I do! I’m a professional chef! (The class gasps.) Oh relax!

It’s not a courtroom drama!",16
Monica," I’m-I’m sorry, it’s just that umm… Well I-I cook at

this restaurant, Alessandro’s, and umm I just got a really bad review…",22
Monica," Okay then, I don’t stink. I’m a good chef. Okay. (Starts to

leave.)",13
Joey," Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it’s time to go, it’s time to go.

(Starts to leave, but comes back for his cookies.)",22
Chandler," …also I was the point person on my company’s transition from

the KL-5 to GR-6 system.",16
Chandler, (nervous) My duties? (Trying not to crack a joke) All right.,11
Chandler," Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y’know

I’ve been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard

to sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesn’t understand) Duties. (Still

doesn’t.) Duties! (Still doesn’t.) Poo. (Still doesn’t.)",47
Chandler," Oh my God this doesn’t count! Okay? The interview was over, that

was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call

security! There’s a crazy guy out in the hall!",39
Rachel," I’m fine, but that’s not important. What’s important is

how was she?",12
Rachel," Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.",10
Ross," What’s uh, what’s going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?",13
Rachel," No! No, she’s—She was nice. I mean, she’s a little

slutty, but who isn’t?",14
Rachel," Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you

Indiana Jones!",16
Ross, Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!,11
Rachel, There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!,12
Rachel," Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I

don’t want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it’s a terrible thing to

even think this, and it’s completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my

constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I’m very sorry, but that is just the way that

I feel.",66
Ross," I won’t date. I’ll uh, I’ll be here, with you, all the

time.",13
Ross," True, but you’re allowed to be unreasonable. You’re having our

baby.",11
Rachel," (starting to cry) Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you. (They hug.)",11
Rachel," No, not really. You’re pressing the baby into my bladder and now I

have to pee. Sorry. (She gets up and starts for the bathroom.)",25
Ross," We live together. You’re having our baby. I’m not gonna see

anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don’t want something more?",22
Ross," Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin’ around! (She’s stunned) Like you

did last night when I had to pee?",19
Rachel," (laughs) I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin’ with you too!

",14
Ross, (pause) Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you…,10
Rachel," No that’s just—(Laughs)—That’s just ‘cause

I’m such a good messer!",10
Joey," Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that’s

the first A I’ve gotten since seventh grade, and I didn’t have to sleep

with the teacher this time.",33
Monica," Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?",11
Joey," Oh, it’s a poster for that World War I movie that I’m in, check

it out.",16
Joey," Uh-huh! I know. I’m coming soon to a theater near you! I’m in

THX! I’m unsuitable for children!",18
Joey," I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? I just 

talked to my agent and the premiere is next week and

you’re all invited! (They all gasp.)",27
Rachel," Well obviously I won’t be able to come, for those of you who

haven’t checked their calendars today is my due date.  ",22
Chandler," Wait, you should come anyway. Maybe 

you'll have the baby in the limo. That way in the first few moments of her life 

she'll think we're really fancy. ",28
Rachel," Well y’know, I just want

to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you’ve been during this time. I

really couldn’t have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine

months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss

being pregnant.",56
Rachel," That’s right, still no baby! (to 

two customers) Boy what's the matter? Is the puffy sweaty pregnant lady 

disturbing your precious coffee time?  (To Monica, Joey, and Chandler on the

couch) Come on people! Please make some room!",38
Ross," Uh sweetie, maybe you’d be more comfortable here? (Gets up from the

green armchair.)",14
Ross," Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.

I mean I wish I were a seahorse. (She glares at him) Because with seahorses it’s the

male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I’d be far away in the sea. (He sits

back down.)",52
Rachel, God. (Sits down.) I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!,13
Phoebe," Oh I know, I’ve been there. I remember toward the end…",11
Rachel," (interrupting her) Oh Phoebe, that’s a great story. Can you tell it

to me when you’re getting me some iced tea? (Phoebe gets up and Rachel groans.) (To

the baby) Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!",40
Rachel," Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? ‘Cause I’ll

do it.",16
Rachel," They sent me home from work. They were like, ""Start your maternity

leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby."" Well y’know what? Screw ‘em!

If they don’t want me there, I’ll just hang out with you guys.",39
Joey, One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!,10
Joey, Oh my God. So that’s it?! I only get to bring one guest?,13
Joey," (to Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe) Did you hear that? I only get one extra

ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.",30
Rachel," I don’t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just

because I’m pregnant you think I’m invisible.",19
Monica," Well, well Ross didn’t care enough to be here, so I think he’s

out. You snooze you lose.",18
Monica," Well then somebody’s snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect

you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut

down to here. (Points to her stomach just above her belly button.)",42
Phoebe," Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart.

What does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) Phoebe, Phoebe.",28
Phoebe," (still mimicking a heartbeat, only faster)

Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe—Burrrrr! (Mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going

off.)",16
Joey," Yeah! Yeah! I mean I’m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but

y’know Chandler always supported my career. He’s paid for acting classes and

head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.",40
Monica," Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you’re

gonna take him? Joey, I don’t think you’re comprehending just how slutty this

dress is!",27
Joey," It’s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it’s-it’s

everything. Y’know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was

really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn’t get parts that I really

wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn’t believe in myself.",57
Chandler, I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.,13
Phoebe," Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.",11
Joey, (in a manly voice) I’m gonna go shave. (Gets up.),10
Chandler," (in a manly voice) Yeah well, I’m gonna go spit. (He goes into

the bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)",25
Rachel," Oh, I have to pee. If I don’t come out in five minutes it’s

because I’ve choked to death on the potpourri stink. (Goes into the bathroom.)",27
Phoebe," When she comes out, you hold her nose, I’ll blow in her mouth, and

the kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.",26
Monica," She’s over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?",11
Phoebe, I don’t know. I-I think it’s still gonna be a while.,11
Monica," Hmm, care to make it interesting? I’ll bet you that she’ll

have it by this time tomorrow.",17
Rachel," (calling from the bathroom) All right, who’s turn is it to help me

get up!",15
Chandler," This is so exciting! It’s so glamorous! People taking our

picture. How do I look?",15
Joey," Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? (Chandler

does so) There you go. (And they walk down the red carpet.)",26
Phoebe," Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you’re still pregnant. Oh, I’m

sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y’know what? You look great. Yeah, like

fifty bucks.",28
Rachel," Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a

squeeze toy. (Goes to the bathroom.)",21
Phoebe," It’s interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?",13
Monica, Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!,12
Phoebe," Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp (She puts the

bill in her bra) right there.",19
Ross, (entering) Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor’s appointment.,10
Ross," People ask me why we’re not together, I just don’t know what to

tell them.",15
Rachel," (entering) All right, all right. Let’s go! 

Oh, wait a minute. (to herself) Do I have to pee again? (waits to tell) No I'm 

good. ",25
Ross," Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor’s keeping the office

open late for us, but if you hurry…",20
Ross," Really? You don’t think that’s a little inappropriate.

(She’s wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)",19
Rachel," Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am

somewhat comfortable.",16
Ross," Fine! Fine! Y’know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You’re the

mommy.",11
Rachel," Oh uh-uh pal! Don’t call me mommy! It’s bad enough you call

your own mother that. (He looks at Monica.)",20
Ross," Either of you want to be Ross? (both 

Monica and Phoebe nod their head 'no')",15
Joey," (onscreen) ""I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all

along."" ",15
Joey," (To Chandler) Okay, this is it. It’s my big fight scene coming up.

(He looks over and Chandler and notices that he’s asleep.)",23
Ross," Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you’ve been a little short with me

lately. I’m not trying to irritate you.",19
Rachel, Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.,11
Ross," Y’know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don’t we not speak

until then.",15
Ross," Y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to

deliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil!",23
Chandler," I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!",10
Joey," Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?",13
Chandler, I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.,13
Joey," You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn’t take any of my

suggestions! I can't believe you fell asleep!",20
Chandler," I can't believe it either. Maybe it 

didn't happen.  Maybe you fell asleep and dreamt the whole thing! 

And this conversation we're having right now is part of that dream!  Wake 

up Joe! (slaps Joey)",35
Joey, That’s for coming buddy. I’ll see you later. (Starts to walk out.),12
Chandler," Don’t go! I’m sorry. I’m so sorry! (Sees another guy

who is still asleep.) Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!

(Looks at him more closely.) Or, call an ambulance.",36
Monica, What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?,13
Rachel, No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.,13
Ross," Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea,

caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.",23
Rachel," Well, there is one thing that we haven’t tried, but someone thinks

that, (mimicking Ross) ""That will open up a can of worms.""",23
Monica," Well what is it? What is it? If it’s gonna help bring the baby

here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.",25
Monica," I’m just saying it’s been a really long time for you. I mean,

women have needs. Do it, get yours!",20
Phoebe," Oh I-I don’t know about that. No, I think that if the two of you

had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic. ",22
Monica," All right, let’s be practical, if Ross isn’t willing to do it,

he’s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow

Chandler—Chandler is good!",31
Rachel," Ok, ok. Yeah, I don't-I don't think I 

want to do that. ",12
Monica," You sure? I'm just saying the baby's 

head isn't getting any smaller.  Yowser!",13
Monica, Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.,10
Monica," Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the baby

and I don’t want to lose again!",19
Ross," What?! While she’s been going through this hell, you’ve been

making money?! You’re betting on your friend staying in this misery?! (Phoebe lowers

her head and shakes it yes.)",29
Rachel," Well, I’m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!",13
Monica, Wait a minute! Now I’m betting against all three of you?,11
Rachel," Oh honey, don’t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow’s the

day.",12
Monica," (counting) 60, 80, 100 (hands money to 

Phoebe)  And 50 (hands money to Rachel)",14
Chandler," Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I

still feel so bad!",20
Joey," (in a baby voice) Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?",13
Joey," Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between

us! Okay? You’ve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took

you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?",50
Joey," Give me a number, I don’t want to owe you anything!",11
Chandler," You don’t owe me anything, I don’t want you money…",10
Joey," Ah-ah-ah! We’re doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head

shots. Right, how much were those?",20
Chandler," Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.",12
Joey," Okay, so that’s another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred,

that’s… (Pauses to figure it out.)",17
Chandler," Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he was

right.)",14
Chandler," Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap

classes…",11
Chandler," Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play

where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out

Jamaican. ",29
Joey," What the hell are you talking about, (in a Jamaican accent) ""The

south will rise again man.""",17
Joey," Okay. Okay, so I’m writing you a check for…So you fell asleep

during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?",24
Rachel, Ross I—We tried all the spicy food. It’s not working.,10
Ross," Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha… Oh God! So…so hot!

(Rubs his eyes.) Oh my—(Laughs.) By the way, you don’t want to touch the pepper

and then touch your eye.",33
Rachel," I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes

me want to have sex with you.",20
Rachel," Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We

know what’s gonna work! It’s doctor recommended!",22
Ross," I’m sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I’m

dying.",13
Rachel," Oh come on Ross, we’ve done it before we’ll do it again,

it’ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.",21
Ross," This is insane, I’m not gonna make love to you just so that

you’ll go into labor.",17
Ross, Always a great way to get in a man’s pants.,10
Rachel," But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of

me as a ketchup bottle, y’know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just

to get something to come out.",37
Rachel," Oh, I know it. You’re right. That’s not sexy. Oh…Oh!

(Drops a fork on the floor.) Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed

over and get it. (Tries too, but can’t quite seem to make it.) Oh God!",44
Ross," Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.",10
Rachel," Come on Ross! I’m miserable here! Come on! You started this, now

you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.",22
Rachel," Oh wow! What now Ross you’re not gonna talk? How on earth will you

ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. (Mimics his breathing.) I mean you’d think

the damn jalapeño would’ve cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That’s not

enough… (Ross jumps over and kisses her.) What are you doing?!",53
Ross," I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the

keys?",18
Rachel," I didn’t uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but

do you think we have time to…",21
Monica," That’s it. I’m done. I don’t care when the baby comes, no

more betting.",14
Monica," Hello? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up.) I

guess we can bet one more time.",17
Monica," How did you know that?! (Runs to yell at Joey’s apartment.) Joey!

Chandler!! It’s time!",15
Monica," You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is

over seven pounds. (Phoebe isn’t interested.) I bet you it has hair. (She’s

still not interested.) I bet you it’s a girl.",36
